	<h1>Paragliding: A Pilot's Training Manual</h1>
	<p>Available from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paragliding-Pilots-Training-Mike-Meier/dp/0975446517">Amazon.com</a>.&nbsp; New pilots should study the first three chapters carefully and watch the DVD a dozen times.&nbsp; Study the hands of the pilots and connect this with how the glider responds.</p>

	<p>Wills Wing has released a new 8th 
	edition of its very popular book, Paragliding – A Pilot’s Training Manual. 
	The 8th edition includes an expanded Bonus DVD, now with a full 90 minutes 
	of narrated video footage. Enhancements in the new 8th edition include 
	numerous additional photos and improved illustrations, and significantly 
	expanded content, including new material on the latest and most proven 
	kiting techniques. Both the written manual and the accompanying DVD have 
	been expanded and enhanced. The eighth edition is now available in two 
	bindings, paperback or hardcover.</p>
	<p>Originally written by Mike Meier, and first published in 1991, the 
	Training Manual has sold more than thirteen thousand copies. Following the 
	release of the greatly expanded seventh edition in 2004, Paragliding – A 
	Pilot's Training Manual has become the complete resource of choice for both 
	new students of paragliding and experienced pilots looking to expand their 
	knowledge and understanding of this dynamic sport. The book covers all of 
	the basic essentials of aerodynamics and principles of flight, along with 
	pilot techniques from the beginner through expert level. The focus is on 
	presenting technical subject matter in a manner that is easy for the average 
	pilot to comprehend without the need for complex theory or equations.</p>
	<p>
The authors emphasize safety throughout with techniques for risk 
	management and dealing with common emergency scenarios. Master pilot and 
	paragliding instructor Rob McKenzie of High Adventure Hang Gliding and 
	Paragliding has characterized it as "Probably about the simplest layout of 
	the concepts of gliding flight ever written. A terrific reference book and 
	training supplement for the beginner through intermediate pilot."</p>
	<p>
While the Training Manual has been updated over the years to 
	reflect changes in the sport, the 7th edition represented a major expansion 
	in the scope and content of the manual. Wills Wing brought onboard 
	paraglider pilots Mark Stucky and Tim Meehan to create a complete revision 
	with an entirely new look, additional subject matter and new illustrations. 
	The 8th edition has been further enhanced, especially the DVD.</p>
	<p>
Mark Stucky, who began his aviation career in hang gliding, is a 
	professional military and NASA test pilot and member of the Society of 
	Experimental Test Pilots, whose flight test experience ranges from sub 20 
	mph speeds in paragliders to beyond Mach 3 in the SR 71 Blackbird. He is 
	best known in the foot-launched soaring community for his informative 
	technical articles and flight reviews in Hang Gliding magazine. Mark has 
	updated the technical content of the manual and greatly expanded the scope 
	of the subjects covered.</p>
	<p>
Tim Meehan is the art director of Hang Gliding &amp; Paragliding 
	magazine and an author of several books on computer illustrating. He is the 
	creative force responsible for the new layout and professional 
	illustrations.</p>

	<blockquote class="italics">
		I just wanted to let you know that we now include your book, 
		"Paragliding: A Pilot's Training Manual" as part of our standard PPG 
		training program. It is such a great book, we decided that every new 
		student should have one.</blockquote>
	<p>Newly covered subjects include specialized soaring topics such as 
	convergence, dynamic, and microlift soaring techniques; speed-to-fly theory, 
	and soarcasting. New chapters now cover towing, competition basics, and an 
	introduction to paramotoring. The focus is on presenting technical subject 
	matter in a manner that is easy for the average pilot to comprehend without 
	the need for complex theory or equations. The authors emphasize safety 
	throughout with techniques for risk management and dealing with common 
	emergency scenarios. The companion DVD allows the pilot to see the specific 
	techniques described in the manual actually being demonstrated, and to 
	review the demonstrations as often as desired to enhance the learning 
	process. The introductory section of the DVD is also a great way to 
	introduce your friends and family to the great sport of paragliding.</p>
