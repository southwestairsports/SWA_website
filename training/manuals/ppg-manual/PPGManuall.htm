	<h1>The Powered Paragliding Bible</h1>
	<p>
	<img alt="Powered Paragliding Bible" class="auto-style1" height="499" src="510j4qxHVpL__SX382_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="384">The Powered Paragliding Bible 4th Edition builds on Paramotoring's 
	most popular training manual and reference guide.&nbsp; Available from
	<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powered-Paragliding-Bible-Jeff-Goin/dp/0977096688/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=E5TN13P49K0T77WNZ1H4">Amazon.com</a>.</p>
	<p>New techniques, improved color, more illustrations and enhanced versions of existing ones make the subject come to life in an easy-reading style. The book guides a pilot from first look at the 
	equipment through first flight and well beyond. </p>
	<p>Experienced pilots will appreciate the entire section devoted to mastering Powered Paragliding. Jeff has drawn from his experience as multiple time U.S. Champion and, more importantly, by 
	learning from our sports most successful instructors. </p>
	<p>Many new photographic and illustrative techniques, including animation, make difficult concepts emerge through the fog. It's full of vivid 4-color pictures and illustrations covering everything 
	from pulling the wing out to mastering many finer points. </p>
	<p>Besides the flying, there is thorough, concise coverage of airspace and rules as they apply to paramotor pilots, PPG aerodynamics, choosing gear and complete coverage of reflex wings. </p>
	<p>If you're looking at getting into powered paragliding, this exposes what you're in for. Chapters 1 through 7 take you through first flights. Later Chapters offer experienced pilots new tools to 
	improve skills and safety. </p>
	<p>It is not meant for self training, an endeavor that has proven expensive at best. But it is a great tool for those who want to be responsible, really learn the sport, learn its nuances, 
	understand the rules and gain life-saving tips. </p>
	<p>It builds on the successful previous 3 editions (you can read more reviews on those editions).</p>
