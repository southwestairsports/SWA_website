	<h1>Powered Paragliding Instruction  –  Tuition Schedule</h1>
	<p>The PPG-1 &amp; PPG-2 courses include all gear necessary for training except the paramotor.&nbsp; As the pilot progresses through the PPG1 course, both he and the instructor will work together to 
	make the best decision on overall equipment needs.</p>
	<p>Here are the details on the <a href="RatingsProgram.pdf">USPPA ratings and requirements</a>.</p>
	
	<h2 id="Discovery_Flight">Discovery training flight – $225</h2>
	<p>For anyone interested in seeing what paragliding is like, we can suggest a Discovery training flight which consists of some basic instruction at our shop and a solo flight at the sod farms where we 
	train.</p>
	<p>Before your flight, you will 
	spend an hour or so at our shop and receive some abbreviated flight school instruction in a simulator to get some of the basics down 
	of flying a paraglider.&nbsp; This can be in the late afternoon, early 
	evening, or when you are available.&nbsp; You will also pay the tuition and 
	complete the paperwork at this time.&nbsp; Your instructor will meet with 
	you at our training area near Santa Teresa, NM (just 
	west of El Paso, TX).&nbsp; You will be fitted with a glider, harness, 
	helmet, and radio and undergo some more instruction in how to fly a 
	paraglider.&nbsp; Launching a paraglider is similar to launching an ordinary kite flown by children.&nbsp; You will then learn how to inflate your glider by running 
	forward.&nbsp; When the instructor determines that you are reasonably 
	comfortable doing a simple inflation, he will hook you up to short line and 
	manually pull you while you are running forward with the inflated glider 
	overhead.&nbsp; This will give you an idea what it is like to be pulled by 
	our hydraulic winch.&nbsp; If all goes well, you will be connected to the 
	winch line and do a short "bunny hop" run.&nbsp; If that goes well, we will 
	pull you up with the winch.&nbsp; Your final height will be anywhere from 500' 
	- 1,000'.&nbsp; Once aloft, the instructor will ask you to disconnect from 
	the tow line, do a turn or two and land.&nbsp; Here is a <a href="http://youtu.be/gl2NI9GxQ34">video</a> of what the launch looks like.</p>
	<p>All persons taking a Discovery training flight must meet our <a href="../physical-mental-reqs.htm">mental and physical requirements</a>.</p>
	<h2>Tandem training flights</h2>
	<p>We do PPG foot-launched tandem flights at this time at no charge in celebration of our PASA certification (as time permits).&nbsp; Please see our <a href="../tandem/tandem.htm">tandem 
	operations page</a> for more information.&nbsp; The weight limit for persons wanting to fly tandem is 190 lbs., 
	not 200 lbs. as mentioned in the <a href="../physical-mental-reqs.htm">physical and mental requirements</a> section.</p>
	<h2>PPG-1 Basic Training – $490 3 days</h2>
	<p>The PPG-1 Basic Training will cover the fundamentals of powered 
	paragliding. You will learn to inflate the paraglider and balance the kite 
	overhead. Training includes covering the terminology, operation and 
	preflight of the motor unit. We will practice the launch sequence in a 
	simulator, and you will experience your first flights in a paraglider 
	(without a paramotor attached). The progress of each student is individual 
	and advancement towards powered flight and/or certification depends on the 
	student's ability to master the necessary skills.&nbsp; Here is info on the <a href="RatingsProgram.pdf">USPPA ratings and requirements</a>.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;Paramotoring requires 
	more training than regular paragliding because of the added 
	weight and complexity of the paramotor.&nbsp; Handling of the glider is significantly more 
	difficult so a pilot must have a good set of basic skills to operate a 
	paramotor safely. We want all pilots to become confident with their skills 
	so they can have a lifetime of safe flight. Your instructor will help you 
	make the right decisions concerning things like the weather and equipment 
	purchases. The first phase of PPG-1 Basic Training includes the use of our 
	glider, helmet, radio, and harness.&nbsp; Students must purchase their own 
	paramotor, at least, in order to complete the final phase of the PPG-1 
	course.</p>
	<p>If you decide to continue your training to the PPG-2 level and above, you 
	will receive a full credit for the cost of your PPG-1 training towards 
	additional training. &nbsp;</p>
	<h2>PPG-2 Beginner Training – $1,990 5-12 Days</h2>
	<p>(If you completed the PPG-1 course with us, you 
	will receive a full credit for the PPG-1 tuition paid.)</p>
	<p>Master the fundamentals of flight in a powered paraglider.&nbsp; This 
	course will take a new student through both PPG-1 (if he has not already completed it) and PPG-2 certification by 
	a USPPA certified instructor.&nbsp; It includes a complete overview of paramotoring and powered paragliding. Upon completion of this course, 
	students are ready for extended paramotoring flights with their own powered 
	paraglider. This is the minimum certification level that allows PPG pilots 
	to fly without the direct supervision of an instructor.&nbsp; If you are 
	considering any PPG certification, we highly recommend that you purchase the 
	DVD "Risk and Reward" and watch it many times.&nbsp; It is available&nbsp;from us.&nbsp; It will give you a clear presentation of what PPG is all 
	about.
		<p>Students will:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Understand the paramotor power pack: assembly, disassembly, preflight, 
	starting, throttle control, power cutoff, fuel/oil mixing, maintenance, 
	torque and thrust effects, special dangers, transporting and storage. </li>
		<li>Earn 
	both the PPG-1 and PPG-2 certifications. </li>
		<li>Learn to control the wing through 
	turns and mild turbulence. </li>
		<li>Begin to understand meteorology and its 
	importance for safe and fun flights here in the desert southwest. Pilots who 
	learn to fly in the mountainous desert of west Texas and New Mexico can fly 
	anywhere. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>Training Includes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>USPPA Syllabus study materials (does not include the PPG Bible textbook which must be purchased separately) </li>
		<li>Computer based log book </li>
		<li>Ground school </li>
		<li>Unlimited hands-on instruction at the training site for your first powered 
	flights.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Training for PPG2 does NOT include flying equipment such as a glider, 
	paramotor, or accessories.&nbsp; You can purchase this equipment from us 
	prior to training or during the last part of your PPG1 training.</p>
	<h2>PPG-3 Intermediate Training – $450 3 days</h2>
	<p>Pilots training for PPG3 must be able to successfully complete a 
	cross-country trip.&nbsp; Please contact us for more information on this 
	advanced certification.&nbsp; </p>
	<h2>Crossover Training (PG to PPG or PPG to PG) – $450&nbsp;1-2 days</h2>
	<p>Students who already have a P2 or higher rating will need less 
	instruction and time to become PPG-2 and vice versa.&nbsp; Pilots may choose 
	to earn <a href="http://www.ushpa.aero/documents/sop/sop-12-02.pdf">USHPA 
	Certification</a>. This will allow the pilot to free-fly a paraglider at 
	many regulated sites.</p>
	<h2>Additional Notes </h2>
	<p>We 
	are always careful to heed all FAA and local regulations concerning ultralight 
	aircraft.&nbsp; Irresponsible and selfish pilots travel about the country spoiling the reputation of all ultralight pilots by engaging in dangerous, annoying, and reckless behavior.&nbsp; By the 
	time the authorities and the locals are on top of things -- they are long gone.&nbsp; Then, when you show up to fly, you face nothing but offended and angry people.</p>
	<p>If you see or know pilots like this, please contact us and we will do what we can to stop it.</p>

	<p>All PPG pilots need to be aware that a paramotor can quit at any time.&nbsp; 
	<a href="warning.htm">Warning!</a> </p>
	<p>Students may 
	begin their training without a paramotor but will not be able to be 
	certified PPG2 or greater.&nbsp; We can help you decide which types of 
	equipment are best for you and provide it.&nbsp; Note: Part of the real cost 
	of training is offset by the student's purchase of equipment from us.</p>
