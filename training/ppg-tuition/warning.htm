	<h1>Paramotor Warning and Caution</h1>
	<p class="auto-style1">Always remember that an ultralight's power plant can quit working at ANY 
	time.</p>
	<p>NEVER FLY OVER TERRAIN WHERE YOU CANNOT MAKE A SAFE LANDING! Always fly 
	within gliding distance of a safe landing area. Do you have to cross areas 
	on which you cannot land? Climb higher or go around. It's that simple! NEVER 
	fly in strong winds (12 mph or more). </p>
	<h2>WARNING!</h2>
	<p>The ultralight, engine and/or components do not comply with Federal 
	safety regulations for standard aircraft and have not received any safety or 
	durability testing. An ultralight is for use in circumstances in which a 
	power plant failure will not compromise safety. Before using an ultralight, 
	engine and/or components, read all instructions thoroughly. </p>
	<h2>DANGER!</h2>
	<p>The ultralight's power plant by design is subject to sudden stoppage! 
	Power plant stoppage can result in crash landings. Such crash landings can 
	lead to serious bodily injury or death. Never fly any ultralight equipped 
	with any engine and/or components at locations, airspeeds, altitudes, or 
	other circumstances from which a successful no-power landing cannot be made.&nbsp; 
	Never depend on a power plant to keep you in the air. </p>
	<p>A POWER PLANT FAILURE IS NO EXCUSE FOR AN ACCIDENT!</p>
	<p>If you ever fly into situations where a power plant failure would be 
	hazardous, you are at risk! If you ever find yourself trusting your safety 
	to a power plant, you are at risk! You have the ability to eliminate that 
	risk!</p>
	<p>Users of ultralight aircraft assume all risk of use and acknowledge by 
	their use that the power plant is subject to sudden stoppage where they will 
	be forced to land.</p>
	<h2>CAUTION!</h2>
	<p>Any sport involving heights, moving parts or flammable fuel may cause 
	injury or death&nbsp;&nbsp; A TOTAL AND COMPLETE PREFLIGHT check before each 
	and every use is of utmost importance.&nbsp;&nbsp; LOOSE CLOTHING AND HAIR 
	can be easily sucked into not only the propeller but into the cooling fan 
	intake!</p>
	<h2>BE SAFE!</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Avoid terrain that will prevent a safe emergency landing.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Maintain 
	sufficient altitude to permit a safe landing in the event of engine failure.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Exercise extreme caution when around a power plant.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Keep children, pets and 
	others away!</li>
		<li>Treat propeller and belts like invisible knives when in 
	rotation. In addition, a prop strike may throw broken pieces hundreds of 
	feet.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Keep hands, flammables, etc. away from hot components of the power 
	plant, especially the exhaust. The power plant can cause burns and fire.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Be 
	sure the craft is secure and under control before starting and throttling 
	up.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Tremendous thrust and torque are produced. Be sure the carburetor is set 
	to idle, and will return to idle after applying throttle before starting the 
	motor. A motor with the throttle stuck in full power is EXTREMELY dangerous.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Make sure the kill switch is functional. </li>
	</ul>
	<h2>PREFLIGHT</h2>
	<p>Each and every component must be checked before each and every use! 
	Inspection of power plant is the responsibility of the user. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Check for obstruction of vent, air filter and fuel filter. </li>
		<li>Inspect 
	throttle linkage and ignition wiring.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Check for leaks, improper condition, 
	and looseness of parts such as lines, hoses and clamps.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Check for cracks in 
	the carburetor adapter or primer bulb. </li>
		<li>Check for cracks and improper 
	attachment of exhaust. </li>
		<li>Check for cracks, looseness of mount, and looseness 
	of engine to mount.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Check for condition and possible deterioration of 
	flexible vibration dampeners (motor mounts).</li>
		<li>Check for visual evidence of 
	excessive oil or fuel leaks and sources of such leaks.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Check for fuel 
	contamination. Check that fuel shutoff is in "open" or "on" position. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>This information is by no means a complete list of things that may need 
	to be checked or could go wrong. Scenarios involving human quality control, 
	unfamiliar applications and uses, and consumer assembly error are too 
	numerous to mention here. Use proper discretion when using and DO NOT use 
	without receiving proper training.</p>
	<p>
Extreme caution should be exercised when 
	assembling or using an ultralight, power plant and/or components, along with 
	patience and knowledge of proper use and care.</p>
