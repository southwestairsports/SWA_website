	<h1>Physical and Mental Requirements</h1>
	<h2>Physical Requirements</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>AGE: Minimum age required to train is 18.&nbsp; Maximum age is 70.&nbsp; However, if you are 46 or older, we may require your health professional to approve your participation in our 
		training program.<br></li>
		<li>ABILITY TO RUN: You must be able to run at least (30) yards in (6) seconds or less.&nbsp; If this is not 
		possible, train for wheeled powered paragliding.<br></li>
		<li>ABILITY TO JUMP &amp; LAND SAFELY:&nbsp; You must be able to jump off a 3' 
	ladder and land safely on the ground.&nbsp; Part of your training includes 
	learning how to fall without injury.<br></li>
		<li>WEIGHT: Student pilot weight minimum is 115 lb.&nbsp; Maximum weight is 200 lb. (190 lb. for tandem flights).&nbsp; If you are overweight for your height and build by more than 
		20%, THIS SPORT IS NOT FOR YOU.&nbsp; Many of those wishing to train have 
	lost the weight necessary.&nbsp; Being overweight greatly increases your risk of injury or death while flying a paraglider.&nbsp; If you are unusually tall, we may make an exception to the upper weight 
		limit.<br></li>
		<li>VISION: Your long distance vision must be good.&nbsp; You must be able to see clearly where you are going while 
		flying.&nbsp; If you need glasses, be sure to have sports-type eyewear, 
		such as "Rec-Specs", that will not accidently fall off while flying.</li>
		<li>LEFT-RIGHT DETERMINATION: If you have difficulty determining which is your right or left, have someone drill you and see whether you can train yourself to instantly recognize which side is 
		which.&nbsp; Getting your right or left hand confused can be EXTREMELY dangerous while paragliding.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2> Mental Requirements</h2>
	<p>Mental stability while paragliding is of critical importance.&nbsp; Paragliding is not the place to see how you do mentally.</p>
	<p>A 
	pilot must never lose self-control.&nbsp; He must not ever panic and/or become 
	disoriented.&nbsp;
Maintaining mental stability is essential for engaging in any 
	activity like paragliding or hang gliding where panic or anything similar 
	can lead to injury or death.</p>
