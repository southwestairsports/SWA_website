	<h1>Legal Details</h1>
	<p>All students must agree to and sign our <a href="InjuryWaiver.pdf">release of liability, waiver of legal rights, and assumption of risk</a> (RWA) agreement.&nbsp; If you are training for 
	paragliding (not powered paragliding), you must also agree to and sign the RWA's of our certifying organizations: <a href="PASA_USHPA_RWA.pdf">PASA</a> and <a href="USHPA_RWA.pdf">USHPA</a>.</p>
	<p>All training is subject to weather conditions at the training site and 
	can be canceled at any time and rescheduled. </p>
	<p>There are no refunds of student fees as a result of lessons being 
	canceled due to weather conditions. Lessons canceled as a result of weather 
	will be rescheduled. If we are unable to complete a program due to an 
	operational shutdown, we will pro-rate a refund or merchandise exchange. 
	There are no refunds or exchanges for students who terminate their training 
	program with us. Programs are not transferable to another individual.</p>
	<p>A 
	surcharge may be applied if a student has missed training for more than (8) 
	weeks unless it is our fault. </p>
	<p>Reservations for training are required and are 
	not confirmed until the full tuition fee for the program is paid. Southwest 
	Airsports LLC reserves the right to modify, change, or delete any aspect of 
	the training programs or fees at any time. All previous editions of this web 
	page are obsolete. Any form of sport aviation, including paragliding, is 
	inherently dangerous and can result in death or serious injury to the pilot. 
	Extreme caution must be observed at all times. </p>
	<p>Paragliding is not a casual sport that you can safely do once in a while, 
	such as with most other sports. It is an extreme sport.&nbsp; Your long term 
	safety depends on regular practice and training. Those who paraglide assume 
	significant risk to their lives and safety. </p>
	<p>Any form of paragliding is an 
	extreme sport.&nbsp; If you tend towards panic or get disoriented easily, consider 
	something else to do.&nbsp; Could you rappel off the side of a 300' cliff without gripping fear? If you cannot, this sport is likely not for you.&nbsp; This sport has many dangers and requires steady nerves to do it 
	safely.&nbsp; The good news is that most people can overcome their natural fear of heights enough to fly safely and enjoy this unusual sport.&nbsp; New pilots have to be patient with themselves!&nbsp; 
	It may takes dozens of flights before you can really enjoy the other-worldly freedom of being a bird.&nbsp; This pilot took months of training to overcome the fear he had when first flying.</p>
	<p>It is unwise to try this sport if your friend/spouse/partner/significant-other, etc. thinks you 
	should and you want to be a "team player."&nbsp; This is a sure way to get injured 
	or worse.&nbsp; If your relationship depends on or would be helped by your taking up paragliding, my advice is: ditch the relationship.&nbsp; It is not worth your safety or life.</p>
	<p>On the other had, take up this sport if you think you would love the prospect of being like 
	a soaring bird flying above the world and are willing to assume the risks.&nbsp; If you train carefully, these risks are greatly lessened.&nbsp; 
	It is not unnatural to sometimes have modest anxiety while flying a 
	paraglider  –  it is a good attitude to have as it helps promote proper 
	respect for the air and what we do.</p>
	<p>We fly because we love paragliding as there is nothing in the entire 
	world like it.&nbsp; The experience is euphoric. </p>
	<p>We reserve the right to refuse training or service to anyone we consider unqualified to participate in this sport – for his safety and ours. Please remember that this is an extreme aviation 
	sport.&nbsp; It is inherently dangerous, often forgiving of neglect and mistakes, but never often enough.</p>
