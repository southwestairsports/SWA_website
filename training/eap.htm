	<h1>Emergency Action Plan</h1>
	<p>Southwest Airsports, LLC<br>5134 Thornton Street, El Paso, TX 79932</p>
	<h2>1. Ground School &amp; Continuing Education</h2>
	<p>Ground school and continuing education classes are held in the home and garage located at the Thornton Street address. &nbsp;The toilet facility is inside the house which the garage is attached to.&nbsp; 
	Here is the EAP in relation to the following situations:</p>
	<h3>FIRE EMERGENCY</h3>
	<p>When fire is discovered:<br>Notify the local Fire Department by calling 911.<br>Move everyone out the building and into the street.<br>Take a head count to make sure everyone is accounted for.</p>
	<h4>Fight the fire ONLY if</h4>
	<p>The Fire Department has been notified.<br>The fire is small and is not spreading to other areas.<br>Escaping the area is possible by backing up to the nearest exit.<br>The fire extinguisher is 
	in working condition and personnel are trained to use it.&nbsp; It is located under the stove top in the kitchen.</p>
	<p>Remain outside until the competent authority (Designated Official or designee) announces that it is safe to reenter.</p>
	<h3>EARTHQUAKE</h3>
	<p>Stay Calm -- Move occupants to the safest location.&nbsp; If inside the house, the bathroom has reinforced walls in the tub of cement with steel.&nbsp;&nbsp; If in the garage, move everyone in 
	an orderly fashion to the street.</p>
	<h2>2. Flight Instruction</h2>
	<p>Flight instruction is held at the <a href="http://southwestairsports.com/SiteInfo/SodFarm/SodFarm.htm">Gardner Turfgrass Farms</a> in Santa Teresa, NM.&nbsp; The training site is not visible 
	from any public roads.&nbsp; So that anyone<br>(including emergency personnel) can easy know how to get to our training area, we provide a
	<a href="http://southwestairsports.com/SiteInfo/SodFarm/sodfarmdirections.htm">map on our website</a> where to turn off Highway 178 to get to the flying site. &nbsp;The site also has our coordinates 
	which can be downloaded into a GPS or a smart phone.&nbsp; We always have a streamer/windsock visible so that anyone in the vicinity can see us. &nbsp;If we need to call 911 we can give them our 
	coordinates and basic directions of how to get to us.</p>
	<h3>First Aid Preparation</h3>
	<p>The First Aid kit is always in the back seat area of our winch truck.&nbsp; Since there is no address where we train, the general directions and coordinates to the sod farm are located inside 
	the first aid kit.&nbsp; Also, the address and precise directions are located in the ‘notes’ section of contact info for 911 in the instructor’s smartphones. The instructor is required to keep a 
	phone with him at all times while teaching.&nbsp; Water bottles are brought to the training area, usually in the rear of the Tacoma pickup which always tows out the winch.&nbsp; Students are 
	encouraged to drink water often to reduce the chances of dehydration or heat stress.</p>
	<h3>In the case of a training accident</h3>
	<p>Since the instructor is trained in First Aid and CPR, he will apply that knowledge to assess the situation and act accordingly.&nbsp; All flying activity will stop until the injured person is 
	assessed, first aid is rendered or the injured person is removed from the flying area.</p>
	<h4>Minor Injury</h4>
	<p>Utilize the First Aid kit to attend to the injury as required.&nbsp; Determine if the injury affects the student’s ability to continue with lessons.&nbsp; Advise student to seek professional 
	medical advice upon getting home.</p>
	<h4>Intermediate – Major Injury</h4>
	<p>Stabilize the patient and the situation. If a wing is involved, be sure that the wing is stabilized and does not present an opportunity to cause further injury to the student.</p>
	<h4>Assess the situation</h4>
	<p>Call 911 if determined to be needed.</p>
	<p>Keep the student stable and comfortable until EMTs arrives.&nbsp; Administer any first aid or CPR that is needed until EMTs arrive.&nbsp; Details of all accidents are recorded on an Accident Report 
	form and submitted to the insurance company and kept on file along with a copy of the student’s waiver.</p>
	<h2>Nearest hospital</h2>
	<p>The Hospitals of Providence Memorial Campus <br>2001 N Oregon St.<br>El Paso, TX 79902</p>
