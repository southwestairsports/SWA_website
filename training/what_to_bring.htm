	<h1>What to Bring to Your Lessons</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>CLOTHING  –  It can be cool in the wintertime so bring warm clothes that 
	you can shed later as the day warms up.<br></li>
		<li>FOOTWEAR  –  This is an extreme sport and footwear is very 
		important. Wear boots with high tops that provide adequate ankle 
		protection.&nbsp; Do not wear boots that have open clips for lacing – 
		they can snag the lines of a paraglider.&nbsp; If you do not have boots without lacing clips. you can use duct tape to cover them.&nbsp; Do not wear sneakers or other 
		kinds of low cut shoes if you want to avoid injury to your ankles.<br></li>
		<li>SNACKS  –  Bring snacks with you. You may get hungry and we are 
	far from any stores. Any kind of physical discomfort, including hunger, 
	dramatically affects a pilot's ability to fly well. We provide cold water 
	but you may want to have carbonated soft drinks for a quick energy boost. It 
	is always important to feel physically well when paragliding.&nbsp; We need 
	to have 100% focus on flying and not on anything else.<br></li>
		<li>GLOVES  –  Wear a 
	pair of gloves with thin leather palms and cloth backs, such as
		<a href="../faqs-tips/pgsetup/gloves.htm">leather work gloves</a>. (Note: Gloves with synthetic palms are 
	easily cut by the lines on a paraglider and are not recommended.) The time 
	will come when you fly high and you will need gloves for warmth so it’s best 
	to get used to them as soon as possible. Gloves of this type are available 
	at stores like Lowes.&nbsp; Wear your gloves as much as you can, such as 
	when you drive, work outside, etc.<br></li>
		<li>LAPTOP, TABLET, OR iPad – You will need this the first time you come to our shop to watch the training videos (if you have not watched them already).<br></li>
		<li>Bring your enthusiasm!&nbsp; 
	Paragliding is more fun than people are allowed to have  –  look forward to 
	it!<br></li>
		<li><a href="../faqs-tips/faqs-tips.htm">FAQs-Tips</a>  – If you have signed up for training, be sure to look through this section, especially the item with an * in front.</li>
