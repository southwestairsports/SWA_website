<h1>Paragliding instruction  details &amp; Tuition schedule</h1>
	<p>The P1 &amp; P2 courses include all gear necessary for training.&nbsp; Note: We have had to increase our tuition because of the additional costs of being a PASA certified school.&nbsp; PASA 
	makes sure that their certified schools train safely and responsibly.</p>
	
	<h2 id="Discovery_Flight">Discovery Flight – $225</h2>
	<p>For anyone interested in seeing what paragliding is like, we can suggest a Discovery Flight which consists of some basic instruction at our shop and a solo flight at the sod farms where we 
	train.</p>
	<p>Before your flight, you will 
	spend an hour or so at our shop and receive some abbreviated flight school instruction in a simulator to get some of the basics down 
	of flying a paraglider.&nbsp; This can be in the late afternoon, early 
	evening, or when you are available.&nbsp; You will also pay the tuition and 
	complete the paperwork at this time.&nbsp; Your instructor will meet with 
	you at our training area near Santa Teresa, NM (just 
	west of El Paso, TX).&nbsp; You will be fitted with a glider, harness, 
	helmet, and radio and undergo some more instruction in how to fly a 
	paraglider.&nbsp; Launching a paraglider is similar to launching an ordinary kite flown by children.&nbsp; You will then learn how to inflate your glider by running 
	forward.&nbsp; When the instructor determines that you are reasonably 
	comfortable doing a simple inflation, he will hook you up to short line and 
	manually pull you while you are running forward with the inflated glider 
	overhead.&nbsp; This will give you an idea what it is like to be pulled by 
	our hydraulic winch.&nbsp; If all goes well, you will be connected to the 
	winch line and do a short "bunny hop" run.&nbsp; If that goes well, we will 
	pull you up with the winch.&nbsp; Your final height will be anywhere from 500' 
	- 1,000'.&nbsp; Once aloft, the instructor will ask you to disconnect from 
	the tow line, do a turn or two and land.&nbsp; Here is a <a href="http://youtu.be/gl2NI9GxQ34">video</a> of what the launch looks like.</p>
	<p>All persons taking a Discovery Flight must meet our <a href="../physical-mental-reqs.htm">mental and physical requirements</a>.</p>
	<h2>Tandem flights</h2>
	<p>We do tandem flights at this time at no charge in celebration of our PASA certification (as time permits).&nbsp; Please see our <a href="../tandem/tandem.htm">tandem operations page</a> for 
	more information.&nbsp; The weight limit for persons wanting to fly tandem is 190 lbs., not 200 lbs. as 
	mentioned in the <a href="../physical-mental-reqs.htm">physical and mental requirements</a> section.</p>
	<h2>P-1 PG Beginner Package – $450 for 2-3 Days</h2>
	<p>This package will allow you to explore the magic of piloting a paraglider 
	and allow you to complete the first phase of certified training  –  a P-1 
	rating for successful students.&nbsp; We provide everything for you to 
	succeed, including a syllabus to study for the test, equipment use for 
	flying, and as many flights as you can take over the course.&nbsp; Sometimes 
	the course is extended another day or more if weather conditions are 
	restrictive.&nbsp; The entire price of the P1 Beginner Package can be 
	credited toward the P2 Novice Certification course if the student decides to 
	continue training to become an independent pilot.&nbsp; Lessons include the 
	use of our training equipment and ground school.&nbsp; Depending on 
	schedules and conditions, the course may be spread over several days or a 
	week.&nbsp; The student will be towed into the air using our pay-in 
	stationary winch at a sod farm in west El Paso.&nbsp; Beginner pilots (P1) 
	can only fly sites under the direct supervision of an instructor.</p>
	<h2>P-2 PG Novice Certification Course – $1,990&nbsp; 8 - 12 days</h2>
	<p>Become a solo novice pilot.&nbsp; This course is intended to teach you 
	how to be a safe and confident pilot, especially in the difficult and 
	challenging conditions we find in the air near high desert mountains. &nbsp;Instruction 
	and practice will prepare you to decide how and when to safely fly your 
	paraglider without the direct supervision of your instructor.</p>
	<h2>P-3 or P4 PG Certification – $450 2-3 days</h2>
	<p>Pilots who wish to become certified as P3 and above must meet all of the 
	<a href="http://www.ushpa.aero/documents/sop/sop-12-02.pdf">USHPA requirements</a> (P3  –  
	paragraph 12-02.15 or page 25; P4  –  paragraph 12-02.16 or page 27).&nbsp; 
	Pilots who train to the P3 level or above must be able to successfully fly
	<a href="../../SiteInfo/Agave/agave.htm">Agave Hill</a> or
	a similar mountain site.&nbsp; For pilots on their way, Jocky Sanderson made a 
	helpful video on cross country flying called <span class="italics">Speed to Fly: A Complete Guide 
	to Cross Country Paragliding (2001)</span> but it is no longer available.&nbsp; 
	However, instructor Had Robinson collected some 
	<a href="../../faqs-tips/SpeedFlyJockySanderson.htm">helpful notes</a> on the video.</p>
	<h2>Crossover Training (PG to PPG or PPG to PG) $350&nbsp; 1-2 days</h2>
	<p>Students who already have a P2 or higher rating will need less 
	instruction and time to become PPG-2 and vice versa.&nbsp; Pilots may choose 
	to earn <a href="http://www.ushpa.aero/documents/sop/sop-12-02.pdf">USHPA 
	Certification</a>. This will allow the pilot to free-fly a paraglider at 
	many soaring sites. Students must provide their own powered paragliding 
	equipment.</p>
	<h2>PG SIV Clinics</h2>
	<p>Please go here for <a href="../../faqs-tips/siv/siv_clinics.htm">information and an important warning</a> concerning SIV clinics.</p>
	<p>Student pilot, Jason Tilley, learning how to fly at the sod farm.&nbsp; 
	Is there anything more fun than this?&nbsp; View is looking up from the ground.

	<h2>Additional Notes</h2>
	<p>Your training will include syllabus study materials, a computer based log 
	book (by request), ground school, and hands-on instruction.</p>
	<p>Our course will prepare you for mountain flying. You will learn how 
	to layout your wing and do a preflight check. Become more at ease with both 
	forward and reverse launches. Learn to control your wing through turns and 
	mild turbulence. Begin the study of meteorology and its effects on flight 
	and much more. &nbsp;It includes the use of all equipment needed for training – 
	paraglider, harness, helmet, and radio. </p>
	<p>We recommend that pilots purchase a glider at some point when progressing through the P2 
	program of study.&nbsp; This will greatly help you later on, as you gain 
	more experience with your own glider instead of a school glider.&nbsp; 
	Students who have their own glider will be able to practice kiting on their 
	own time and thus gain much more out of their course of instruction.&nbsp; 
	Kiting skills are essential for pilot safety.&nbsp; It is one of the most 
	important skills a pilot can learn that will dramatically reduce the risks 
	of this sport.</p>
	<p>Successful graduates of this program will be certified as Novice Pilots 
	(P2) and authorized to fly P2 rated sites without the direct supervision of 
	an instructor.&nbsp; Pilots who make it through our P2 certification will be 
	some of the best trained pilots of any paragliding school.&nbsp; We spend 
	the time to ensure that you can safely fly anywhere in the world.&nbsp; Our 
	regional sites provide some of the greatest rewards and challenges that a 
	pilot can face including
	<a href="../../SiteInfo/DryCanyon/DryCanyon.htm">Dry Canyon</a> in the Sacramento Mountains and
	<a href="../../SiteInfo/LeesLookout/LeesLookout.htm">Lee's Lookout</a> in Franklin Mountains State Park.&nbsp; Building your 
	confidence in flying in safe conditions is what we strive for.&nbsp; If you 
	train with us, you will have the skills you need to always fly safely.</p>
	<p>Part of our equipment is an ATV which we use to fetch the drogue 
	parachute after it falls to the ground.&nbsp; This machine saves time!&nbsp;

	<p>Below, pilot Lee Baker thermals away to cloud base from the sod farm 
	after a tow up  –  he was the first to ever do this.&nbsp; There is no 
	greater thrill than using hard earned skills to stay in the air for hours at 
	a time using the sun's energy as our "engine."&nbsp; We rarely have the buoyant air that Lee experienced that day.&nbsp; Most of the time, our skies are cloudless and the location and strength of 
	thermals are much harder to determine.</p>
