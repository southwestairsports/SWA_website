	events.</p>
	<h2>Presidents Day Weekend</h2>
	<p>This event at the 
	<a href="http://southwestairsports.com/SiteInfo/Guadalupe-Ridge/guadalupe-ridge.htm">Guadalupe Ridge</a> began in 
	the late 1990's.&nbsp; Pilots from Colorado and northern New Mexico who were 
	tired of being snow bound started camping out at the Rim as a means of 
	getting out and flying during the winter doldrums.&nbsp; Other pilots in the 
	region soon followed suit and over last few years the skies over the Ridge in 
	February have been filled with gliders for 3 to 5 days.&nbsp; Although 
	conditions are not always perfect, serious amounts of airtime and loads of 
	fun have been had.&nbsp; In 2004 and 2005 over 20 pilots camped out.&nbsp; 
	If you have never experienced this event it is definitely one not to miss.&nbsp; 
	The Rim is remote, so bring all of your necessities -- no cell service, no 
	utilities.&nbsp; Site conditions generally favor HG but small windows in the 
	early morning have been observed when the winds drop below 15 mph for 
	PG.&nbsp; Contact us for more details on the weather there.</p>
	<h2>Earth Day Fair</h2>
	<p>Alamogordo, NM is an annual non-flying event where RGSA 
	members and other pilots meet with the public to promote hang gliding and 
	paragliding in our region.</p>
	<h2>Spring Campout at Dry Canyon</h2>
	<p>This event has been held 
	during the last weekend of April for the last couple of years.&nbsp; 
	Although campouts at 
	<a href="http://southwestairsports.com/SiteInfo/DryCanyon/DryCanyon.htm">Dry Canyon</a> have been numerous over the years and held 
	at different times the Spring Campout was designed to get club members 
	together for the beginning of the XC season and to make plans for the 
	upcoming events during the strong soaring conditions of May and June.&nbsp; 
	It takes a 4-wheel drive to make it to the camping area at the meadow half 
	way up the road to Dry Canyon.&nbsp; Flying from Dry Canyon is just a short 
	distance away from the camping areas.&nbsp; PG pilots who are skilled can 
	top land and walk back to camp.&nbsp; </p>
	<h2>Memorial Day Fly-In</h2>
	<p>Held at 
	<a href="http://southwestairsports.com/SiteInfo/DryCanyon/DryCanyon.htm">Dry Canyon</a> and has a history 
	that goes back to 1979.&nbsp; It was officially held for the first time in 
	1980.&nbsp; Like most meets in the early days, it was just another excuse 
	for the local pilots to get together for some bragging rights.&nbsp; The 
	meet has turned out to one of the great meet success stories in the U.S., 
	not only for its fun flying and super soaring conditions, but for those who 
	wish to compete for awards.&nbsp; This is a full fledged event with all the 
	trimmings and one not to miss.&nbsp; The official USHPA National Fun Fly-In 
	was held here in 1991 and 2005.</p>
	<h2>Columbus Day Fly-In</h2>
	<p>Held at
	<a href="http://southwestairsports.com/SiteInfo/DryCanyon/DryCanyon.htm">Dry Canyon</a> since 1987.&nbsp; This meet is a scaled down version of the 
	Memorial Day event and is geared even more towards the fun aspect of 
	soaring.&nbsp; Conditions this time of year are slowing down a bit which is 
	ideal for paragliding.&nbsp; XC flights of seventy miles and more have been 
	made.&nbsp; It's another one of the great times of fun flying in southern 
	New Mexico and there is lots of everything pilots are looking for.&nbsp; 
	Meet at the Cox Field LZ for Dry Canyon, about 8:00 am each day.&nbsp; One 
	of the RGSA officers will meet you and be sure you get a ride to launch.&nbsp; 
	After a day's flying, pilots will be able to meet for a barbecue and fun at 
	a nearby home in the evening.</p>
	<h2>Veterans Day Fly-In</h2>
	<p>Held in the Franklin Mountains State 
	Park (FMSP) in El Paso, TX.&nbsp; It is primarily a PG event but HG is also 
	welcome.&nbsp; Most of the sites in the Franklins require a short hike for 
	access and this has discouraged HG (but we are working on this).&nbsp; The 
	primary site is
	<a href="http://southwestairsports.com/SiteInfo/Agave/agave.htm">Agave 
	Hill</a> or
	<a href="http://southwestairsports.com/SiteInfo/LeesLookout/LeesLookout.htm">Lee's Lookout</a>, depending on the weather.&nbsp; The Franklin Mountains 
	offer incomparable ridge soaring -- something that the Sacramento Mountains 
	(Dry Canyon) do not accommodate as well.&nbsp; There is abundant camping (no 
	utilities) in the Park.&nbsp; FMSP is the largest park in the U.S. that is 
	entirely within city limits.&nbsp; Before registering for this event or 
	flying here, it is important to thoroughly read the requirements for flying 
	within the Park.&nbsp; These can be found at the bottom of the page for Agave 
	Hill.&nbsp; For the sturdy, they can do the 2.75 hour hike up to the 
	summit of N. Mt. Franklin and enjoy a 40 minutes sled ride or combine both 
	ridge soaring and thermalling.&nbsp; (Links here are courtesy of
