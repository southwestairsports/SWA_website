	<h1>RGSA Annual Meeting 2009</h1>
	<p>by George Woodcock/Secretary Golden Corral, Las Cruces, NM</p>
	<p>The RGSA held it’s 28th annual January meeting at Golden Corral in Las 
	Cruces, NM on Saturday the 24th of Jan 2009 at 5:00pm. </p>
	<p>In attendance: Mike Ellsworth, Bill Cummings, Velma Woodcock, Robin 
	Hastings, Doak Hoover, Hadley Robinson, George Woodcock, Judith Valle, Linda 
	Valle, and guest Lance Tripoli(NWS-EP) </p>
	<p>Doak Hoover(VP) brought the meeting to order at 5:30 and turned the 
	meeting over to Velma Woodcock (P). </p>
	<p>Agenda #1: Velma discussed the current status of the RGSA, including the 
	forest service and the city of Alamogordo. The loss of the city lease for 
	the landing area and the future of the RGSA landing there was discussed. 
	Velma gave a report of a meeting that her, George and Kieth Trembley 
	attended with the city recreation rep and youth team reps. Although the 
	local youth soccer and youth football groups wish to gain control of the 
	landing area, the city has decided that they are in favor of the RGSA and 
	wish to leave the field open without obstructions for all people to use. 
	However, these teams may be using the field to practice, usually during the 
	week late afternoons. Reservations for exclusive use must be made with the 
	city for our fly-ins or any other local groups who wish to reserve it; other 
	times we are still allowed to land there. (just watch out for other folks!). 
	As for the forest service, Mike E says that they are already talking about 
	forest closures again this spring because of the dry conditions. With this 
	in mind we discussed the up coming meets. The RGSA will attempt to hold the 
	Memorial Day Fly-in and plans to pursue that agenda. Hadley and Doak 
	suggested that we try to tow at the local airport if the forest gets closed. 
	BC, Doak, Hadley, and George agreed to help with contacting the local 
	airport manager to set things up. </p>
	<p>Agenda#2: Velma asks the secretary/treasurer for the financial update of 
	the club. The report is $1092.00 balance with $513.00 due by the end of Jan 
	09 for: site insurances ( Alamogordo &amp; El Paso) $425.00, PO Box $58.00, NM 
	PRC $10.00, Website $20.00 for the month of Jan 09. George said that this 
	time last year the RGSA funds were at $1500.00, but the cancellation of 
	Memorial fly-in costs were above $800.00 for shirts, the city permit and 
	award engravings. However, Velma has been able to recuperate around $400.00 
	with tee shirt sales. Note: During the meeting a total of $410.00 was 
	collected, some of which were dual memberships with the SSA. George said 
	that in the past the RGSA usually receives enough DM membership money from 
	the SSA to bring the club back to the starting balance of $1092.00. </p>
	<p>Agenda#3: Velma proceeded with the election of officers for 2009 process. 
	Nominated and elected in order were as follows: George 
	Woodcock-Secretary/Treasurer Doak Hoover-President Robin 
	Hastings-Vise-President Hadley Robinson- Newsletter Editor </p>
	<p>Agenda#4: Velma turns the floor over to the new President, Doak Hoover. 
	Doak talks about the upcoming events for 2009 and the possibility for 
	changes to our fly-in dates. Because of the dry forest and the cancellations 
	of many of last few year fly-ins in May, Doak asks for support of a July the 
	4th fly-in at Dry Canyon. The club responds with agreement. The club also 
	discusses other times that we can set aside for group flying at our local 
	sites. Doak closes the meeting at 6:45 pm and will decide the next meeting 
	time this spring. </p>
	<p>RGSA secretary notes: We welcome Judith and Linda Valle as new members at 
	the meeting. Also Lance from the National Weather Service. I reserved these 
	exclusive dates with the city for our LZ at Dry for 2009: </p>
	<p>1. Feb. 14, 15, &amp; 16 2. May 23, 24, &amp; 25 3. July 4, 5, &amp; 6 4. Sept. 5, 6, 
	&amp;7 5. Oct. 10, 11, &amp; 12 </p>
	<p>The cost per day is $15.00 when finalized, so lets use them and don’t 
	lose them!</p>
