	<h1>Lesson Learned</h1>
	<p>(The hard way.) </p>
	<p>By Bill Cummings </p>
	<p>Tossed like a leaf in a tornado I was totally freaked out and wishing I 
	had never headed my 155’ Magic III hang glider into the giant dust devil. 
	Today, Wednesday July 10, 1991 was the peak of the day in the peak of the 
	strong thermal season over the tilled wheat fields of central Washington 
	State. It was my wife Terry’s day to drive and she had Gene Stone (A friend 
	from Pharr, TX.) at the top of the 2,000’ static tow line and he was just 
	about to release from the line. I wanted to radio Gene to tell him not to 
	follow me into the dust devil but the transmit switch was mounted on my 
	helmet and I couldn’t make my self let go of the control bar. I had stupidly 
	broken my own rule to never fly into one of these giant dust devils. The big 
	devils that leave a circle print on the ground measuring a half mile in 
	diameter. The smaller “dusties,” that come to a point on the ground are a 
	size that usually won’t peg my coward meter. I pulled myself half way 
	through the control frame so as not to stall in the turbulence. The extra 
	speed made the turbulence feel twice as rough but still it was stalling from 
	time to time. This speed seemed the middle ground between stalling and 
	tumbling or being beat to death with the keel tube when going weightless. I 
	checked to make sure my tow bridle would not be in the way if I had to reach 
	for my parachute handle. The handle was in the clear but amazingly the 
	thought of the parachute being ready to be thrown offered very little 
	comfort. </p>
	<p>“I WANT TO LAND NOW!” I mused. </p>
	<p>I flew out of the side of the thermal and way below I could see the only 
	good shade tree near the town of Withrow, WA where I could knock down the 
	glider in comfort. In my haste to land I totally forgot what HG pilot Buck 
	McMinn had taught me about landing during the heat of the day out here. 
	“Pick out a good spot to land and hang out above it and slightly up wind. 
	Wait for a thermal to go through your landing spot then leave it and auger 
	down fast and land before another thermal can build and go through again.”
	</p>
	<p>Just as I went vertical to go to the down tubes for landing a thermal 
	broke loose and I had to go prone again to gain control! The glider was spun 
	to the right and now I’m leading the way across the ground with my left wing 
	tip! (About right here is where I remember what Buck had told me about 
	landing during the heat of the day.) Here comes the ground! I’m still prone! 
	It’s time to flair! I push out the basetube! I’m still moving sideways! I 
	face plant! I blast out through the left downtube! The right downtube kinks 
	in sideways at midpoint! The keel tube snaps in two just ahead of the 
	control frame! The dust devil is now trying to lift me off of the ground! I 
	hang onto what is left of the keel as close to the nose as I can reach while 
	still hooked in! The glider starts to lift me off of the ground! I start 
	screaming like preteen girl! The thermal drops me into another face plant! I 
	do the fastest unhook I’ve ever done! </p>
	<p>I was so glad to be down that I didn’t even get mad about having kinked 
	so much aluminum. It was the longest 30 minute flight I can think of. Gene 
	Stone flew 17 miles in good air. I got five miles. More than enough distance 
	for me on this day. The glider was too broken up so I couldn’t move it into 
	the shade to knock it down. I didn’t care. I was down. I was down!</p>
