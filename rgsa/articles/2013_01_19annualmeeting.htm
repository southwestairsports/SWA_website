	<h1>Annual RGSA Meeting 2013</h1>
	<p>Golden Corral Restaurant Alamogordo, NM </p>

	Jan Z, Lee Baker, and Had Robinson flew at La Luz the afternoon before the 
	meeting. Rod Burton &amp; John Hotovec were drivers. </p>
	<p>2. Robin Hastings, President, opened meeting </p>
	<p>3. Had Robinson, Secretary, gave the financial report. $ 264.50 in the 
	bank and our insurance for the year PAID. </p>
	<p>4. Robin moved that we increase dues for 2013 to $30. Move was seconded

	Robinson (secretary/treasurer), John Hotovec (visitor) </p>
	<p>6. Had noted that we had a good year for training pilots – about 20. Most 
	were transients and moved on. We have (3) new PG pilots trained by Had that 
	flew at La Luz today. </p>
	<p>7. Report on Columbus Day, Memorial Day, Amigo Airshow. It was a good 
	year. </p>
	<p>8. Items for Discussion </p>
	<p>a. LZ at Dry Canyon – may have to have our shade structure moved. 
	Currently no access from the east but that will change soon. </p>
	<p>b. Dry Canyon access road – needs some manual cleanup (by hand). Robin 
	suggested we have a club workday. Needs a second wind sock at Curt’s Bluff.
	</p>
	<p>c. Other Sites: Kilbourne has been good this year. Little Floridas – Bill 
	noted that the carpet at launch is so bleached out that it is visible from 
	Google earth. Pilots noted Adobe Deli is a great place to eat near Deming.
	</p>
	<p>d. New launch site: (removed per request of the BLM - July 29, 2013) </p>
	<p>e. 2013 Events </p>
	<p>Guadalupe Event on President’s Day. Bill C. and Mike E. had an argument 
	about how far from the rim to the LZ. Robin said it’s 50 miles. Mike was 
	right. </p>
	<p>Earth Day – Robin’s event </p>
	<p>Memorial Day at Dry Canyon – OK’d. Bill C. LZ and grill guy, John Hotovec 
	is the meet-head, Lee Boone will do the T-shirts and trophies (only one 
	first for each event), Matt Hayes will be the launch director, </p>
	<p>Columbus Day - will be very casual. </p>
	<p>9. Election of Officers for the new year. </p>
	<p>a. President – Matt Hayes – election was almost unanimous except Mike E 
	said “no”. Thank goodness a fight didn’t break out! </p>
