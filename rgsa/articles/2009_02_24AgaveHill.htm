	<h1>First Flight at Agave Hill</h1>
	<p>by Robin Hastings</p>
	<p>February 24, 2009 </p>
	<p>In 2007 and 2008 our two best paraglider pilots, Doak Hoover and Hadley 
	Robinson, developed new launches in Franklin Mountain State Park. This is 
	one of the biggest city parks in the world, located on the north edge of El 
	Paso, and Doak and Had worked for years to obtain permission to fly it. They 
	have succeeded beyond our dreams – the park staff actually enjoy having us 
	there, and in flight after flight we’ve proven to be responsible aviators. 
	They’ve launched off several points, including North Franklin Peak, the 
	highest peak in the park at 7000 ft MSL. Historic flights! But their 
	favorite site, for accessibility as well as consistency, is a lower knoll 
	they’ve named Agave Hill. On June 6, 2008 I joined the pioneering effort by 
	being the first pilot to fly it with a hang glider. </p>
	<p>Agave Hill is easy to get to. Enter the park, take care of the required 
	waiver (Hadley can tell you all about it) and then drive up to a nearby 
	parking lot. From there, it’s a 20-minute hike, uphill about 200 feet on a 
	decent 4WD road. (Until we get permission to drive up it, bring a friend to 
	help with your hang glider!) The hill allows launches from west/northwest to 
	west/southwest. Too much southwest in the wind can bring some turbulence 
	from a parallel ridge, so due west is probably the optimum wind direction 
	for this place. The launch is at about 6000 ft MSL and about 600 feet above 
	the landing zone(s). Where I chose to land was a large, open area of brush 
	due west of the site, about a 6-to-1 glide, just beyond a picnic area with 
	shade structures. The launch itself is a rounded slope of about 30 degrees. 
	The setup area, thanks to brush clearing cheered on by the park, will 
	accommodate at least 10 hang gliders at once. </p>
	<p>Once we got my Airwave K5 up to the site, with all my gear, I looked it 
	over and started clearing brush. Hadley made a late-morning launch while I 
	was working on this, and hit some great lift near the LZ – I found this very 
	encouraging. He and Doak were accustomed to weaving their way amid agaves 
	and prickly pear cactus as they trotted off with their wings 20 feet 
	overhead – but I could see no way to do that with my hang glider. It took a 
	couple of hours, but we finally had a clear shot at putting me into the air 
	in anything from southwest to northwest, depending on cooperating winds. I 
	set up the K5, and then waited. The winds this day were light, and gradually 
	shifting; they’d started west/northwest, and were now veering more and more 
	to the southwest. I harnessed up and drank almost the last of my water - 
	clearing brush is thirsty work! I finally got a light breeze, picked it up 
	and started my launch. OOPS! Bad timing! I got 2 feet into the air and 
	realized the glider was veering to the left. I managed to abort the launch 
	without a problem – nothing bent, not even a whack. So we brought the glider 
	up to the launch again, where I inspected it and then waited for something 
	more straight in. About an hour later I finally got what I wanted – a breeze 
	of 10-12 mph (according to Had’s shouted measurements), a thumbs-up from 
	Doak, and what looked like actual consistency to me. I yelled “Clear!” one 
	more time, and started my run down the slope. No problems! I lifted off and 
	sped down the hill. A spectating hiker, JP, had obliged us by clearing a 
	tall yucca that was otherwise on my flight path, and I cruised. I didn’t 
	soar, however. The air was bumpy, and the hill’s configuration is such that 
	I was never more than 100 feet above the ridge that ran out below me. I 
	headed out to the main park road, out ahead about a half mile, where Hadley 
	had hit lift hours before, but now it wasn’t there. Ah, well. I made a 
	gentle turn to dump extra altitude, over the picnic grounds, and set up for 
	a straight west approach. Landing went well, all in all, and I skidded it in 
	– the only down part being the prickly pear I ran my butt over at the last 
	instant. Down safe! I looked back up the hill to where I’d come from, glad 
	to have made it and glad to have tried it – even with the cactus spines. 
	Lessons learned: This site is potentially quite good if you get a due west 
	wind a little stronger than what I had. (It’s great for paragliding!) The 
	plan would be to launch, work the lift enough to gain 100 feet or so, then 
	shoot over a 100-yard gap on the left to The Triangle, a major slope up 
	Franklin Peak. You could easily work the ridge lift and thermals there, and 
	bench up until you are actually soaring North Franklin Peak. Once up there, 
	at 7000 ft MSL, you could stay up for hours, and start off XC to the north. 
	The landing zone I chose is the obvious one, but it might not be the best 
	one – there’s another, closer to Transmountain Highway, that might serve 
	better. Doak and Had frequently land their PG’s in an arroyo. The main 
	advantages of Agave Hill are its access (paved road all the way to the 
	parking lot) and its benign, smooth slope launch. It’s a hike up from there, 
	however. Just from the pioneering aspect, I’m glad I flew the site; when the 
	winds look right, I’ll fly it again and see where it takes me.</p>
