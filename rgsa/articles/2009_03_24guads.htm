	<h1>The GUADS 2009</h1>
	<p>2009 By George Woodcock </p>
	<p>This was probably the warmest weather I have seen in The Guadalupe Rim 
	campout ever. Velma and I where only able to enjoy this beautiful, eventful 
	bash for two days this year. We arrived on Saturday, February the 14th in 
	the late afternoon. It had been flyable early that day, but was blown out by 
	the time we got there. Still there were a lot of smiling faces to be seen, 
	even though we had passed by two pilots on hwy 137 heading out as we where 
	coming in. I understand that one of those pilots was Ed from Gunnison and an 
	Albuquerque pilot, whom I don’t recall his name. Word was that they had 
	logged flights for three days before we arrived, starting as early as 
	Wednesday. Some of the flights where long, two hours or more with top 
	landings and some short flights landing at the lower LZ. Erik Semrua from 
	Phoenix and I had flown Dry Canyon in marginal conditions on Friday the 
	13th, but the Guads where soarable that day. Velma and I were greeted by 
	several pilots on Saturday; Erik had arrived before us. Already camped out 
	were the Texas guys Kent Robinson and Chris Chaney; Gunnison pilots Tony 
	Brown and Pete(formally from Albuquerque; Albuquerque pilots Bill Lemon, 
	Andrew Vanis, Dave Demill, John Nagavary, Mario Manzo and Steve Cortez. 
	There was an English pilot there as well. It was unusual not to see Tony 
	Sitts and Rusty Whitely from Gunnison, as they are always there. </p>
	<p>Saturday evening the winds quieted down and we had a great evening of 
	fine dining ( elk, duck, squash, etc.) and brewage consumption, not to 
	mention the tales and experiences shared. It was a wonderful night enjoying 
	the beautiful weather. Everybody there was grateful for Chris Chaney’s 
	dedication to keeping a bonfire going, especially the exercise involved of 
	moving their chairs forward and backwards from the fire pit. Nobody 
	complained either night we there, not that I remember. LOL </p>
	<p>Sunday morning was very warm with a light NE breeze. Velma and I visited 
	with Mario and his friend Fran around their breakfast campfire next door. 
	Pilots where up early as history tells us to do at the Guads in order to 
	beat the higher winds. This year the winds stayed steady out of the NE and 
	never got strong enough except to fly a few stunt kites. Around 10:00 with a 
	light overcast and the conditions looking like they would not change most of 
	the folks opted to set out for the artesian wells near Sitting Bull Falls. 
	Kent was the main guide for this adventure even though people took different 
	paths that way; some walking the 3 mile hike in from the Queen HWY. There 
	was a short period of time when the winds started coming in out of the NW 
	around 3 o’clock, which brought everybody racing back to the campground. The 
	PG’s quickly set up near the rim at the camp, but to no avail. The winds 
	slowly went from 10mph to zero at dusk. It was another great evening of 
	Chris’s bonfire and friendship. </p>
	<p>Monday the forecast was calling for a West wind to be blowout early, but 
	the wind gods did not wake up until late in the day. We all headed for 
	launch after breakfast, only to stand at launch waiting on the light North 
	wind to change. Most of us left after 12:00 or 1:00, Velma and myself 
	included. For those few who stayed, they got to fly. I understand Kent 
	launched into a west wind before 2:00 working hard for an hour before 
	landing at the bottom LZ. Three other pilots (Tony, Erik, and Pete) got in 
	some great ridge soaring for an hour or so landing on top before the wind 
	gods took over and blew the launch out. Those last three pilots left on 
	Tuesday morning after a night of high winds. “The GUAD WINDS”. Still it was 
	a very enjoyable weekend and week that we all know and love at the Guadalupe 
	Rim!</p>
