	<h1>RGSA Annual Meeting 2012</h1>

	<p>1. Robin, President of the RGSA, opened the meeting </p>
	<p>2. Report on Finances: Had reported that we had (before current dues) 
	$1,197.27 in our bank account. Robin suggested we get the other members to 
	pay our dues soon. </p>
	<p>3. Report on Flying and Facilities </p>
	<p>a. Lee &amp; Had need to check out Wyler Tramway in the Franklins for 
	launching. </p>
	<p>b. FMSP – we may be able to use an ATV or a 4 wheel to access Agave and a 
	section of the road to the top to N. Mt. Franklin. Lee and I will check out 
	access to Mundy’s Gap </p>
	<p>c. Site work at Lee’s Lookout – scheduled February 4th at 1PM. </p>
	<p>4. Report on training of new pilots (Had Robinson) – 3 new student pilots 
	with a possibility of 3 more. Robin said, “Say ‘Hi’ to Daniel Moquin &amp; 
	family.” </p>
	<p>5. Known issues </p>
	<p>a. New windsock for Cox Field LZ – we voted spend the money to buy a new 
	windsock for the LZ. George Woodcock can get the price on it. Price will be 
	in the range of about $100-$150. Mike E. will call George to get the ball 
	rolling. </p>
	<p>b. Access to Cox Field LZ – Bill C. reported that it is currently blocked 
	but there is access from the north. Robin will call the Park to check out 
	access and future of the cabana. </p>
	<p>c. Access to launches and landing fields misc. - It’s good to have carpet 
	for the PG pilots at our fly ins. BC Launch is accessible and was flown for 
	the first time by Had in a PG. </p>
	<p>d. New Sites – Windy Point now has a great LZ for both PG and HG thanks 
	to the Mescalero-Apaches. DACA will allow us access for PPG and probably PG 
	towing. </p>

	<p>a. Mesilla Valley Balloon Rally – Glenn, Had, and Lee were more popular 
	than the balloons J </p>
