The Rio Grande Soaring Association is dedicated to the sports of hang gliding and paragliding in 
southern New Mexico and west Texas.  We have many launch sites in both states.  We conduct 
platform truck towing (HG) from the Las Cruces city airport and dynamic towing from a sod farm 
near Santa Teresa.  Our main flying site is Dry Canyon which is just east of Alamogordo.  The 
RGSA leases a large area from the city of Alamogordo for the Dry Canyon LZ.  The RGSA is 
proud to work with the city of Alamogordo, the Lincoln National Forest, and Franklin Mountains 
State Park of El Paso, TX to keep our local flying sites open.  The RGSA is a chapter member 
(#41) of the United States Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association.  We carry site insurance 
provided by USHPA to protect our flying sites.

The RGSA welcomes everyone to get involved in our sport.  Club memberships are open to the 
public to both pilots and non-pilots.  We offer full memberships ($25 for pilots)and associate
