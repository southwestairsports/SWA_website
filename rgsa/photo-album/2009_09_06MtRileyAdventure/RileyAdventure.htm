<h1>
	Mt. Riley Adventure #2</h1>
	<p>
	Doña Ana County, New Mexico<br>September 6, 2009</p>
	<p>Riley is the taller peak in the middle.&nbsp; Note the heavy storms over the area - they all dissipated after a few hours.&nbsp; The Three Sisters (Riley, Cox, and No-Name) are giant thermal 
	generators and air over this area is always going up which is why there are so many storms here. </p>

	<p>Grady Viramontes (P2) and his instructor, Had Robinson, ventured out to the middle of nowhere for a first – Grady is the first native born, native trained PG pilot to fly Mt. Riley.&nbsp; 
	Conditions were mild that afternoon with a weak NE breeze.&nbsp; In the photo below Mt. Cox is visible in the background.&nbsp; Our trucks are parked around the base of Riley to the left (out of 
	sight here).</p>

	<p>The hike to the top was about 40 minutes from the access road that is about 1/2 way to the top on the west side.&nbsp; This is a "hike-'n-fly" mountain in a remote area of south central New 
	Mexico = dark sky, no services, no power lines, not much....&nbsp; The top of Riley is ideal for PG/HG launch as there are no obstructions of any kind -- just a smooth cone with grass and small 
	rocks at the summit.&nbsp; This peak had a small jar with a notebook for visitors to give the date and their names.&nbsp; Hopefully, an ambitious hang glider pilot (Robin Hastings?) will be the 
	first to fly from the top (we'll get a crew to haul up the glider). </p>

	<p>Grady did a forward launch about 6:00 PM as the breeze was not more than about 2 mph and sometimes it was calm.&nbsp; As a P2 about to have his first mountain launch, the lateness of the day 
	made sure that the air was not turbulent.&nbsp; The view below is to the NE -- a few water tanks out there and that's it.&nbsp; The whole region is quiet, peaceful, and beautiful.&nbsp; What a 
	privilege to fly out into the air in such a place as this! </p>

	<p>View of the summit looking south.&nbsp; Mt. Cox is to the right and the East Potrillo Mountains are to the left. </p>

	<p>Grady is soaring out in front of the summit with the East Potrillo Mountains to the left distance. </p>

	<p>Grady was able to safely soar the windward face of Riley about 10 minutes before he headed for the alluvial plain which surrounds the mountain. </p>

	<p>The wind changed from NE to east and then Had launched in light winds around 7PM.&nbsp; He was able to soar the face until dark.&nbsp; The pointed shadow seen in the photo below is of Mt. 
	Riley. </p>

	<p>There was enough of a breeze to allow a pilot to soar above the summit of Mt. Riley.&nbsp; The East Potrillo Mountains are visible in the upper left in the photo below.&nbsp; If there was more 
	time before dark, we could have jumped across the gap and soared the east face of this range for many miles.&nbsp; However, such an adventure requires a ground crew to pick up the pilots -- which 
	we did not have this time. </p>

	<p>In the photo below:&nbsp; Mt. Riley (foreground), Mt. No-Name (center), and the West Potrillo Mountains (rear). </p>

	<p>It was getting dark and we had to come down.&nbsp; Both pilots safely landed and walked back to where their trucks were parked (the area that is to the center left of the photo above).&nbsp; 
	Grady just landed below - in the one of the biggest LZ's in the USA. </p>
