		<p>We had perfect weather this day, particularly for frogs....</p>
		<p>Pilots of today's hopeful paragliding group were (left to right):&nbsp; 
		Visitor Ron Kohn (OK), Doak Hoover, Grady Viramontes, 
		Martha Desmond (driver), and visitor Matt Nagel (MO).&nbsp; (Had Robinson 
		is not visible because he took this shot.)&nbsp; Visitors and family are 
		always welcome!<br>

		<p>The following photos speak for themselves.&nbsp; We had virga, rain 
		(even 
		at launch), gusty winds, dust devils, and everything else that encourages 
		soaring aircraft to stay on the ground.<p>In the photo below, note the 
		dust devils (intense thermals) that released along the shadow line of 
		the huge cloud above.&nbsp; Thermals start as large bodies of buoyant 
		hot air next to the ground.&nbsp; Physics tells us that matter of 
		different temperatures does not tend to mix which is why these parcels 
		of hot air do not immediately rise and mix with the cooler air above.&nbsp; 
		Meanwhile, these parcels grow warmer and warmer from the sun.&nbsp; But 
		at some point, they must rise and this process can begin when a trigger 
		or catalyst is encountered.&nbsp; This can be a road, a power line, a line 
		of buildings, or some important difference in the terrain, including a 
		shadow from a cloud as we see below.&nbsp; A boiling pot of water 
		illustrates the same principle where the bubbles of steam begin at the 
		same points on the bottom.&nbsp; In fact, in smooth glass containers 
		water can be superheated to far above the boiling point so that when a 
		few sharp glass chips are tossed in, the water nearly explodes.&nbsp; 
		The thermals below, similarly, are exploding into the air above.<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC02139.JPG" width="1024" height="768"><p>It was cold at launch and, 
		being wet, 
		we almost built a fire to stay warm.&nbsp; When it was raining, we threw 
		the gliders in the cab of the truck and the pilots either got soaked, 
		crawled under the truck, or took refuge under some rock outcroppings.&nbsp; 
		Only our cherished driver, Martha, earned the only space in the truck.&nbsp; The 
		rain cloud below passed over us earlier.<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC02143.JPG" width="1024" height="768"><p>We 
		waited as long as we could and conditions got worse so we all headed to 
		the Golden Corral for dinner - and that was a success!&nbsp; Next 
		time....&nbsp;</td>
