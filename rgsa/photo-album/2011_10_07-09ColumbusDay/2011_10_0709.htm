		come to enjoy the good autumn air. Not that many this year, but those

		<p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt">When I arrived at the Cox Field LZ 
		about 1:30 I found our old friend Jason Otto from Tucson there. We saw 
		Mike Ellsworth's truck, and that was it no sign of the pilot himself. We 
		soon found out that he was at Dry Canyon launch with Bill Cummings and 
		Dave Church. Eventually, when the winds relented a bit, DC took off and 
		had a very nice flight. He was surprised to find only light winds when 
		he finally reached the field, and rolled it in after completely crossing 
		from east to west. We had dinner at a nearby cafe afterwards - DC, me, 
		Bill, Mike, Jason, Had Robinson, and Joe Schad and Zelda Zadnik from 
		Virginia.</p>

		<p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt">Next morning it was blowing cold and 
		north, but just as forecasts predicted, it eventually got lighter, and 
		westerly. Powered PG's went up in the morning (the City of Alamogordo is 
		now allowing them, it seems) and then the rest of us drove to launches. 
		Dry Canyon looked OK - but the gate up to the La Luz launch was locked. 
		Andy Miller and Terry from Tucson came up to launch, but it was pretty 
		strong, and only Andy made it off. Everyone with a hang glider launched 
		- me, Joe Schad, Lee Boone and Doctor Bob Brockmann, down from Denver. I 
		was Wind Dummy, with Bill on my nose wires, soon followed by Bob and 
		Joe, and finally Lee. There was some big sink between the West Ridge and 
		Cox Field, and both Lee and I landed short. (And that after reaching 
		2500 feet over launch – the injustice of it all!)</p>

		<p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt">There was a nice barbecue that evening 
		with bratwurst and pork steaks, then good visiting around the portable 
		fireplace that George and Velma Woodcock brought over. Next morning 
		looked much better for Dry Canyon, with skies clear and winds light and 
		variable. I did some driving this time, and watched as Glen Tupper from 
		El Paso landed his powered PG at Dry Canyon launch, in 10-15 mph 
		south/southwest winds. He packed the engine in my truck, then foot 
		launched his wing and soared back down to Alamogordo. Others did it more 
		conventionally, and it turned out to be a great day of flying.</p>

		<p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt">Low saves were made and cross country 
		miles were flown, with Dave Church reaching the gravel pit north of La 
		Luz and Andy making it 23 miles south in his PG. More barbecue, more 
		visiting, more campfire and beautiful autumn stars – how can you beat 
		it? On Monday morning we said farewell to Jason and his dog Kimba, the 
		Tennis Ball Fanatic. My friend Jesse Cone drove for Dave Coleman, me, 
		Bob and Joe, while Had did the same for the PG pilots, including John 
		Davis from New York.</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt">Everyone launched and had a fine time, 
		with Dave reaching 10,500 ft MSL (3500 over launch) in his Sport 2, and 
		getting almost two hours airtime. John immensely enjoyed his first 
		experience in a PG at Dry. This time, everyone made the field! As the 
		afternoon wore down we packed up gliders and said goodbyes. Andy took 
		the PG Open XC trophy back to Tucson, while Bill promised to deliver the 
		hang gliding version to Dave Church. John Davis had the Spot Landing 
		trophy for PG's, while Bob Brockmann had the same for hang gliders – 
		adding to the vast collection of fly-in trophies he has accumulated from 
		us over the years. Has the man no sense of fair play and decorum? We 
		said goodbye to Joe and Zelda, Champion Driver, who hope to attend a 4th 
		time next year, despite the long miles from Virginia. At the end Bill, 
		Dave Coleman and I shook hands and vowed to return. Fly safe, drive 
		safe, and have a lot of fun, everyone! --&nbsp; <b>Robin</b></p>

		<p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt">by Had Robinson</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt">On another day early in the morning 
		when the winds aloft were too light to fly, Glenn Tupper and Had 
		Robinson made a visit to the enchanting and quiet canyons of La Luz and 
		Laborcita.&nbsp; These two canyons are nestled up in the foothills of 
		the Sacramento Mountains a few miles northeast of Alamogordo.&nbsp; They 
		each have plenty of springs (water) and can grow an amazing amount of 
		fruits and vegetables, including cherries.&nbsp; As the canyons face 
		southwest and are protected by high mountains to the north, they have a 
		warmer climate (more sun) and a better growing season than the basin 
		below.&nbsp; Cold north winds tend to go around the mountains in the 
		rear rather than over into the canyons.</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt"><font size="2">Below is the view entering the canyons.&nbsp; 
		La Luz is to the right and Laborcita (the smaller canyon) goes gently up 
		to the middle of the photo here.&nbsp; View is northeast.</font><br>
