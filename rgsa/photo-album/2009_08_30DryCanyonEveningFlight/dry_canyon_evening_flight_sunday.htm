		<font size="5">Dry Canyon evening flight Sunday, August 30, 2009</font><p>Pilots Robin 
		Hastings, Mike Ellsworth, and Had Robinson took off for launch around 2 
		PM in the afternoon.&nbsp; Our driver (and photographer) was David 
		Sanderson of El Paso.&nbsp; Arriving at the top, we noticed 
		overdevelopment in the east which sourced gusty outflows at launch so 
		everyone took a few hours off, relaxed, and watched the storms go after 
		it in the east.&nbsp; Hang glider pilots Mike and Robin launched around 
		6:30PM.&nbsp; Paraglider pilot Had Robinson launched about 20 minutes 
		later.</p>
		<p>Thermals were calming down so all was left was ridge lift caused by a 
		strong south wind - more than adequate for PG'ers to get 1,000' over 
		launch but not strong enough to keep HG'ers up.&nbsp; Mike and Robin 
		found some air in front of the west end of the ridge and then headed for 
		the LZ.&nbsp; Had stayed up until dark.&nbsp; The air going over the 
		ridge was doing close to 20 mph so PG'ers had to be careful with 
		drifting into stronger air up and behind the ridge.</p>
		<p>David took the stunning photos below.&nbsp; We also are very thankful he could drive us to the Dry 
		Canyon launch.</p>

		<p><font size="2">The moment of launch - a single misjudgment or misstep here can mean

		<p><font size="2">Had setting out his glider at launch.&nbsp; For a PG pilot this is a 
		critical time to examine the lines for knots and tangles.&nbsp; Failure 
		to notice such things can cause the glider to spin into the cliff after 
		launch or stall -- all bad.</font><br>
		<img border="0" src="IMG_0057%20doc.JPG" width="1024" height="683"></p>
		<p><font size="2">The only smooth air at the Dry Canyon launch is right at the edge of 
		the launch ramp.&nbsp; The area behind is turbulent from rotor caused by 
		the cliff and vegetation at the edge.&nbsp; The pilot has to get the 
		glider 15' feet or more into the smoother air above before he can assess 
		that it is safe to launch.</font><br>

		<p><font size="2">Had is well on his way to 1,000' over launch -- plenty high.&nbsp; 
		The winds increase as you go up into the atmosphere so PG pilots have to 
		be careful not to fly too high in strong conditions.&nbsp; Today's were 
		borderline.&nbsp; Also, as the winds hit the Dry Canyon Ridge they are 
		compressed and speed up as they go over the top.&nbsp; The air right 
		over the Ridge can, therefore, be a trap so pilots always have to 
		carefully watch their speed over the ground and not venture close to the 
		Ridge in strong conditions lest they get blown over the back of the 
		Ridge and enter turbulent, dangerous air.</font><br><img border="0" src="IMG_0119%20doc.JPG" width="1024" height="683"></p>
		<p><font size="2">Getting the last gasp out of the flying day...we have to land while 
		we can still see.&nbsp; While not visible in the photo, Had is carrying 
		a strobe light that is visible for miles.</font><br>

		<p><font size="2">At the launch ramp, Robin must make the decision as to exactly when 
		he will launch.&nbsp; The wire crew is needed in case a gust catches the 
		front of the glider.&nbsp; If there is not someone there to hold the 
		nose down, the glider can flip over backwards or accidently launch - 
		both bad events.</font><br>
