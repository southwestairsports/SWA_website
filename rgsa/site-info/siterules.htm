	<h1>RGSA Site Rules</h1>
	<p>Revised February 2015</p>
	<p>Anyone (including visitors and drivers) present within operating areas 
	including launch, landing, and setup must sign the 
	<a href="ushpa-release-waiver.pdf">USHPA waiver</a>. &nbsp;Please give the executed waiver to any RGSA member or 
	officer.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
	<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All participants in setup, launch, flight and landing activities 
	must be current members of USHPA, having signed the current USHPA Release, 
	Waiver and Assumption of Risk Agreement.</p>
	<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All participants must comply with all FAA Rules and Guidelines 
	applicable to the setup, launch, flight and landing activities at the site.</p>
	<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All pilots must wear appropriate Safety Helmets during launch, 
	flight, and landing.</p>
	<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All pilots should perform a harness connection check before 
	launching.</p>
	<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before flight operations are first conducted at a new flying site, 
	the local FAA Branch and local general aviation operators should be notified 
	of the operational area.</p>
	<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that other exempt air space uses are present in the 
	vicinity of the flying site (ex: Radio Controlled Aircraft, Model Rockets, 
	Kite Flying, etc…) coordination with those other uses should be made to 
	minimize the risk of interference or possible mid-air collisions.</p>
	<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All flight activities should be in compliance with 
	<a href="ushpa-pilot-proficiency-system.pdf">USHPA Pilot Proficiency System 
	-- Standard Operating Procedures 12-2</a>.</p>
	<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Launch Areas – Launch Areas should be clear of personnel (other 
	than current USHPA members directly involved in flight operations), 
	structures, and vehicles 50 feet forward and 30 degrees either side of 
	center of anticipated take off course and 30 feet rearward of starting point 
	target. (Distance is 75 feet forward for tandem flights.)</p>
	<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designated Landing Zones and Targeted Landing Areas – Spots 
	designated or targeted for landings should be located at a minimum of 100 
	feet from overhead power lines and 50 feet from ground personnel, vehicles, 
	structures, in-use roads and spectators.</p>
	<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearance from Overhead Power Lines, Trees and Towers - Planned 
	flight path should remain clear of overheard power lines, trees and towers 
	by 75 feet. Launch points should be clear of overhead lines, trees and 
	towers by 50 feet.&nbsp; Landing target spots should be clear of overhead 
	lines, trees and towers by 100 feet.</p>
	<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;No planned flight should take place within 50 feet of spectators on 
	the ground.</p>
	<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;When spectators are present or at organized events in areas where 
	weather conditions exist that increase the chance of a glider inadvertently 
	lifting-off, tie downs or other methods of securing the aircraft should be 
	employed for unattended gliders, in the set-up and disassembly areas.</p>
	<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;Demonstration equipment at organized events should be manned and 
	secured by authorized personnel until disassembled. Signs should be placed 
	in front of all such equipment at events, cautioning the public not to 
	attempt to utilize the equipment without supervision.</p>
	<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;At organized events the designated Safety Director will be 
	responsible for designating a spectator and vehicle parking area clear of 
	gliders in a manner reasonably calculated to separate spectators and 
	vehicles from glider operations.</p>
	<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;At organized events, signs should be posted and/or personnel should 
	be assigned at launch and landing areas to warn spectators and competitors 
	to stay clear of launch and designated landing areas.</p>
	<p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;At organized events, only USHPA pilots and approved competition 
	staff who have signed a USHPA waiver should be allowed in the designated 
	launch area.</p>
	<p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;At organized events, only photographers approved by the event 
	coordinator who have signed the USHPA waiver should be allowed in launch 
	area or below launch area.</p>
