	<h1>Flying Site Information</h1>
	<p>The RGSA insures and maintains a number of sites in its region. Here is 
	information on several sites. The following pilots can help you with flying 
	our sites.&nbsp; Please contact one of them if you would like more 
	information.&nbsp; We want you to have a fun and safe experience.&nbsp; For 
	additional information and photos of most of these sites, please visit
	<a href="http://southwestairsports.com/SiteInfo/SiteInfo.htm">Southwest 
	Airsports</a>.</p>
	<h2>Contacts for Site Info</h2>
	<p>Robin Hastings (575) 541-5744&nbsp; HG<br>Bill Cummings (575) 541-0803&nbsp; HG<br>Mike Ellsworth (575) 937-4840&nbsp; 
	HG<br>Lee Boone (915) 256-1772&nbsp; PG &amp; HG<br>Had Robinson (915) 726-2698&nbsp; 
	PG</p>
	<h2>Site Rules</h2>
	<p>All pilots must abide by our <a href="siterules.htm">site rules</a>.&nbsp; You will not be permitted to fly at our 
	insured sites* unless you 
	agree to our site rules.&nbsp; These rules apply to all visitors.&nbsp; 
	Flying in the Franklin Mountains State Park has
	<a href="http://southwestairsports.com/SiteInfo/Agave/registration.htm">
	additional rules</a> which are enforced by Park Police.</p>
	<p>Remember that a hang check is required before launch at all RGSA sites, 
	and a buddy check of your glider and harness is also strongly recommended.&nbsp; 
	For Dry Canyon and La Luz, follow these two safety rules: </p>
	<p>If White Sands starts dusting up, it’s too turbulent to be safe. Don’t 
	launch, or if you’re in the air, land as soon as you can get to the LZ. It 
	is no fun being a leaf in the wind… If you find yourself near the launch, 
	looking up at it, start for the landing zone! You are getting low a long way 
	back from a landable area.</p>
	<h2>Dry Canyon (2400' AGL, launch 7000' MSL) </h2>
	<p>This is a thermal and ridge-soaring site above the city of Alamogordo, 
	New Mexico. It’s rated Hang 3 and Para 3, with prior mountain experience. It 
	is in a bowl, and may be flown in wind directions ranging from S-SE to due 
	West, but the launch ramp faces due Southwest, which is where the prevailing 
	winds are from. It is not suitable for top landings.</p>
	<p>The primary LZ is an 8-acre field about an 8:1 glide off to the west 
	located here 32° 55.706'N 105° 56.722'W. The setup area can accommodate 
	about 30 gliders at once. The launch is a concrete ramp about 15 feet long, 
	sloping down at about 30 degrees. In winds of 20 mph or more, the site 
	becomes turbulent, and a wire crew becomes essential. A sled run is 
	typically 10 to 15 minutes in duration; soaring flights of several hours are 
	common, and the XC record is 132 miles.</p>
	<p>Launch access is by a rough 4WD road, on US Forest Service land.&nbsp; 
	Contact us for directions to launch.</p>
	<p>Directions to 
	the LZ: From White Sands Blvd. in Alamogordo, take Fairgrounds Road east 
	about a half mile, to the Ball Parks. Head down the right side of the park 
	to the end.</p>
	<h2>Agave Hill (600' AGL, launch 5,250' MSL)</h2>
	<p>Please to Southwest Airsports site info for
	<a href="http://southwestairsports.com/SiteInfo/Agave/agave.htm">Agave Hill</a> 
	for more information on this challenging site.</p>
	<h2>Gardner Turfgrass, Inc. Sod Farms (4,081 ft. MSL)</h2>
	<p>This is our primary training site located in Santa Teresa, NM.&nbsp; The 
	<a href="http://southwestairsports.com/SiteInfo/SodFarm/SodFarm.htm">sod farms</a> 
	are each about 1/4 mile in diameter and have the features under tow of a training hill about 1,000' AGL.&nbsp; Southwest Airsports <a href="http://southwestairsports.com/training/Training.htm">stationary towing</a> to both paragliders and hang gliders.</p>
	<h2>Guadalupe Ridge - Big Dog Canyon (1,600' AGL,&nbsp; 32.084805° 
	-104.809092°, launch 6,000' MSL) </h2>
	<p>This is a thermal and ridge-soaring site northwest of Carlsbad, New 
	Mexico. It’s rated HG/PG 2 with prior mountain experience.</p>
	<p>It is the rim of 
	a vast valley that runs about 20 miles due north &amp; south, and may be flown 
	in wind directions ranging from Southwest to due West. The valley is flat 
	and grass covered, about 6:1 from launch, and can be landed anywhere. The 
	site is marginally suitable for top landings.&nbsp; A PG pilot was hurt in 
	the rotor in December 2000.&nbsp; If a top landing is desired, be certain that 
	you have enough altitude to fly behind launch far enough to get out of the 
	rotor.</p>
	<p>The setup area can accommodate 50 
	gliders at once. The most commonly used launch is a dirt slope about 50 feet 
	long, sloping down at 45 degrees. In winds of 20 mph or more, the site 
	becomes turbulent, and a wire crew becomes essential. This site can get very 
	windy indeed, and blowouts are common. Plan to fly early! A sled run is 
	typically 5 to 10 minutes in duration; soaring flights of several hours are 
	common. As of the year 2009, no XC flights have been made from this site.</p>
	<p>Access to launch is by a graded 2WD road, on US Forest Service land. Access to the LZ 
	in the valley involves an almost-4WD section, however.</p>
	<p>This site is popular 
	for club campouts, and is very remote. Take lots of extra food, water and 
	gasoline. Sitting Bull Falls, a popular recreation site for swimming in 
	spring-fed pools, is a 2-hour drive from the launch site.&nbsp; Contact RGSA 
	members for directions.</p>
	<p>PG from this site is "iffy" even during the winter months as conditions 
	tend to be too strong to safely launch and soar the ridge.&nbsp; We are 
	researching better times when PG pilots can safely fly, such as in the fall.</p>
	<h2>Kilbourne Hole Maar Training &amp; Soaring Site&nbsp; (500' AGL, launch 4,000 
	MSL)</h2>
	<p>This is an unusual site in that it is not a hill but an ancient volcanic 
	crater or maar.&nbsp; It is about 2 miles in diameter in the midst of a flat 
	plain about 30 miles west of El Paso, Texas.&nbsp; Access to the launch is 
	by 2WD dirt road. Getting to the bottom of the maar requires a 4WD vehicle 
	with good clearance.</p>
	<p>The highest launch point is on the east rim of 
	the maar, and may handle wind directions from southwest to northwest.&nbsp; 
	This launch is a smooth, sandy slope about 30 to 45 degrees and about 200 
	feet long.&nbsp; The primary LZ is a flat, grassy area about 800 feet 
	across, a 6:1 glide straight out from the launch.</p>
	<p>This site is ideal 
	for first flights for both hang gliders and paragliders.&nbsp; It was first 
	soared by Robin Hastings (HG) and Had Robinson (PG) and has now been visited 
	by other pilots from around the United States and the world.&nbsp; You must 
	stay above the rim or the lift disappears very quickly.&nbsp; Top landings 
	are safe and easy.</p>
	<h2>La Luz (1,100' AGL, launch 6000' MSL) </h2>
	<p>This is a thermal and ridge-soaring site above the village of La Luz, 
	just north of Alamogordo, New Mexico. It’s rated Hang 2 and Para 2, with 
	prior mountain experience.</p>
	<p>It has 3 launches, and may be flown in wind 
	directions ranging from SW to due North depending on the ramp used. Top 
	landings are marginally possible. The primary LZ is an enormous field about 
	an 8:1 glide off to the west. The setup area can accommodate about 15 
	gliders at once. The SW launch is a slope about 30 feet long at about 30 
	degrees. The NW launch is a slope about 10 feet long, about 15 degrees. The 
	West launch is a slope about 15 feet long and 15 degrees. In winds of 20 mph 
	or more, the site becomes turbulent, and a wire crew becomes essential. A 
	sled run is typically 5 minutes in duration, but soaring flights do occur. 
	The XC record is 55 miles.</p>
	<p>Directions to the LZ: From Hwy 70/54 go on Hwy 82 
	east towards Cloudcroft. Take a left at the blinking lights that mark 
	Florida Avenue, and go north about a mile or so to Valley View Drive, about 
	100 yards before you reach the trees of the village. Go right about ¼ mile to where you can look over the barbed wire into the huge open 
	field. Don’t drive into the field, though – it’s private property.</p>
	<p>Hazards: 
	There is a power line running from northeast to southwest across the east 
	edge of the field.</p>
	<h2>Las Cruces Airport (launch 4,500' MSL)</h2>
	<p>This is a hang gliding towing site west of the city of Las Cruces, New 
	Mexico. Use of it has been granted by prior arrangement with the Airport 
	administration. The tow operator and/or pilot must have a Unicom radio 
	capable of communicating with standard powered aircraft. The runways are 
	over a mile long and are suitable for all wind directions. Cross country 
	flights over 50 miles are common from this site. Please contact the RGSA 
	for more information.</p>
	<h2>Little Floridas (1.000' AGL, launch 6,000' MSL) </h2>
	<p>This is a thermal and ridge-soaring site southeast of the town of Deming, 
	New Mexico. It’s rated Hang 2, with prior mountain experience. It may be 
	flown in wind directions ranging from SW to due West.</p>
	<p>Top landings are 
	marginally possible.</p>
	<p>The primary LZ is an enormous field about a 4:1 glide 
	off to the southwest. &nbsp;The setup area can accommodate about 5 gliders at 
	once. The launch is a wooden platform about 10 feet long at about 30 
	degrees.</p>
	<p>In winds of 20 mph or more, the site becomes turbulent, and a wire 
	crew becomes essential. A sled run is typically 5 minutes in duration, but 
	soaring flights do occur. The site XC record as of May 2011 is 48 miles and 
	was made by hang glider pilot&nbsp; Bill Cummings on a flight to Las Cruces.</p>
	<p>The LZ is near Rockhound State Park. Access to the launch is by 4WD only. 
	Please contact the RGSA for directions to this site.</p>
	<h2>Long Ridge (3,000' AGL, launch 7,500' MSL) </h2>
	<p>This is a thermal and ridge-soaring site above the city of Alamogordo, 
	New Mexico. It’s rated Hang 3 with prior mountain experience. It is a sharp 
	ridge that projects like a fin to the west from the Sacramento Mountains, 
	and may be flown in wind directions ranging from South to North. In a due 
	West or due East wind, it is not launchable. The site is not suitable for 
	top landings.</p>
	<p>The most commonly used LZ is a flat area near the Alamogordo 
	Golf Course, about a 10:1 glide off to the Northwest. The setup area can 
	accommodate about 15 gliders at once. The North launch is a dirt ramp about 
	8 feet long, sloping down at about 15 degrees. The South launch is a slope 
	about 20 feet long and about 45 degrees.</p>
	<p>In winds of 20 mph or more, the 
	site becomes turbulent, and a wire crew becomes essential. A sled run is 
	typically 10 to 15 minutes in duration; soaring flights of several hours 
	have been made, and the XC record is 60 miles.</p>
	<p>Access is by a rough 4WD road, on US Forest Service land. Contact the 
	locals for directions to the areas used for landing at this site.</p>
	<h2>Mesquite Dam Training Site (launch &amp; landing 4,000' MSL) </h2>
	<p>This is an 80-ft sandy training hill, about 10 miles south of Las Cruces 
	near Interstate 10. To reach it, take the Mesquite Exit, turn east and go to 
	the frontage road. Take that north about a mile, and turn right to cross a 
	cattle guard. Follow the dirt road to a big dam, then turn north along the 
	base of the dam about a quarter mile. As the road climbs gently uphill, take 
	the left-hand fork (ground there is a bit more solid) and top out. Park in 
	the flat area on top of the dam, and use the crescent-shaped hill about 100 
	yards to the east. The hill can take wind directions from west-southwest to 
	south-southwest.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the site is subject to the quirky 
	winds of the Rio Grande Valley and rarely has steady winds from the 
	southwest.&nbsp; A much better training site than can be driven to is
	<a href="http://southwestairsports.com/SiteInfo/BlackMountain/black-mountain.htm">
	Black Mountain</a>.</p>
	<h2>Veracruz (600' AGL, launch 6,000' MSL) </h2>
	<p>This is a thermal and ridge-soaring site east of the town of Carrizozo, 
	New Mexico. It’s rated Hang 2 and Para 2, with prior mountain experience.</p>
	<p>It 
	is on a north/south ridge, and may be flown in wind directions ranging from 
	SW to due West. It is not suitable for top landings; the primary LZ is near 
	a windmill and stock tank, about a 5:1 glide off to the southwest. The setup 
	area can only accommodate about 3 gliders at once. The launch is a slope 
	about 50 feet long, going down at about 45 degrees.</p>
	<p>In winds of 20 mph or 
	more, the site becomes turbulent, and a wire crew becomes essential. A sled 
	run is typically 5 minutes in duration; soaring flights of several hours are 
	common, though, and the XC record is about 50 miles. Access is by a rough 
	4WD road, on private ranch land, and then a 100-yard hike uphill with the 
	gliders. Flying is by prior arrangement only; please contact the local 
	pilots to schedule a day of flying.</p>
	<p>The RGSA primary HG training site is a 
	200-ft cone shaped hill about 2 miles to the west of Veracruz, on the same 
	ranch.</p>
	<p>*Insured sites include: Dry Canyon, La Luz, Gardiner Turfgrass Farms, and 
	all sites in the Franklin Mountains State Park.</p>
