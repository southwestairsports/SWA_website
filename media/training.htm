	<h1>PG Training Videos</h1>
	<p>These videos include both PG and PPG.&nbsp; Go to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=infidelmeister">
	YouTube site</a> for many more videos of both PG and PPG.</p>
	<h2>A. Landing</h2>
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BoV3uUue04">Perfect landing</a> 
	by a student pilot (PG)</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Reah6zO-0">Landing properly</a> 
	(PPG) – The pilot lands flying a reflex glider.&nbsp; Always watch the 
	hands.&nbsp; If a pilot flares too early he will always have a rough 
	landing!&nbsp; If he flares too late or not at all, he will have to run 
	more/faster but his landing will not be hard.&nbsp; This is the hardest 
	concept for new pilots to understand.</p>
	<h2>B. Launching</h2>
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7lKwp5lrzY">Perfect launch</a> 
	– a student pilot demonstrates a perfect PG launch in light winds</p>
	<p><a href="https://youtu.be/2DCgyNJScw0">Cravat at Launch</a> – Why pilots 
	always must check their gliders BEFORE committing to launch.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/WAf1LKF5GeQ&hl=en&fs=1&">FAILED LAUNCH</a> 
	 –  An example of a failed launch by a pilot who lacked basic wing handling 
	skills.&nbsp; It is exceedingly dangerous to attempt a launch from an 
	advanced site, like Dry Canyon, if a pilot is unable to control his glider 
	on the ground.&nbsp; He was fortunate he was not injured or killed.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0OLHA5kaSs">Failed PPG launches</a> 
	– After a number of tries, the student pilot gets it right.&nbsp; Includes 
	his landing.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0aMu_oSKPc">GOOD LAUNCH I</a> 
	 –  What a safe and controlled launch should look like.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwQsnc339Jk">GOOD LAUNCH II</a> 
	 –  Control of the glider is critical when conditions are turbulent at 
	launch.&nbsp; Want to be an expert pilot?&nbsp; Become an expert kiter.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9DqwNYxAEA">LAUNCHES BY VARIOUS 
	PILOTS</a> in slow motion  –  Watch the hands!</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl2NI9GxQ34">LAUNCH FROM TOW</a> 
	by a student</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCLeFwwzzQw">LAUNCHING WITH 
	HANDS EVERYWHERE I</a></p>
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_my13ITM-K0">LAUNCHING WITH 
	HANDS EVERYWHERE II</a></p>
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjlSVObZPU8">LAUNCHING WITH 
	HANDS EVERYWHERE III</a></p>
	<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/0sBYihr42UA&hl=en&fs=1&">HOLDING THE 
	A'S TOO LONG</a>  –  A student pilot does his first forward launch from a 
	benign mountain site.&nbsp; Because it is not a cliff launch, the frontal 
	collapse he experienced (from holding on to the A's too long) is of little 
	consequence.&nbsp; Every pilot needs to ensure every launch is perfect – this is why first class training is essential for safe flying!</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuwQHV8C_Yg">LAUNCHING WITHOUT 
	HAVING THE GLIDER UNDER CONTROL</a>  –  It is not safe to turn and go before 
	you are certain the glider is stable and free of tangles/cravats.&nbsp; 
	Conditions were moderate with weak thermals.&nbsp; The pilot was fortunate 
	that the site was easy.&nbsp; A cliff launch with a gust could have sent him 
	into the rocks.&nbsp; The same pilot and another had some much better 
	launches.</p>
	<p><a href="https://youtu.be/MAOCVtN-ZEo">LAUNCHING WITH TOO MUCH OR TOO 
	LITTLE BRAKE FROM A MOUNTAIN SITE</a> – New pilots need to kite as much as 
	possible in order to be able to fly "blind".&nbsp; That is, to be able to 
	control their glider and know its location without looking at.&nbsp; When a 
	pilot's brain gets overloaded (as here) he tends to make more mistakes.&nbsp; 
	Anapra Mesa is a good place to make these kinds of mistakes while learning 
	how to ridge soar.</p>
	<h2>C. Accidents</h2>
	<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/CPCnQ12DagA&hl=en&fs=1%2522">JOE PARR'S 
	ACCIDENT</a>  –  Joe Parr's famous tip stall, spin, spiral dive, reserve 
	deployment, and tree landing in Valle de Bravo, Mexico 2005.&nbsp; He made 
	at least (10) major errors as a pilot.&nbsp;&nbsp; See if you can find them.&nbsp; 
	(Here is a <a href="../faqs-tips/jparranalysis.htm">complete analysis</a> 
	of the mishap by Had Robinson.)&nbsp; We appreciate Joe making this superb 
	teaching aid available to the world.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHmzpQDBW-Q">NEAR ACCIDENT</a> 
	 –  Poor launch and kiting skills nearly sends pilot into the trees</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/PvSlxFkoukg&hl=en&fs=1">NEAR COLLISION</a> 
	 – These two pilots are pros but did NOT check the launch area to see if it was clear before takeoff! Almost a tragedy.&nbsp; If these pilots had attended our school, they would have learned not 
	to do this.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/6vThjveEkz8&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0">YO-YO 
	RIDE</a>  – Why pilots need to be careful and launch in the proper conditions 
	 –  it can be a yo-yo ride.</p>
	<h2>D. General</h2>
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX9HnsmSZaM">RESERVE DEPLOYMENT 
	I</a>  –  Here is a very smooth deployment of a reserve – the way it should 
	happen.&nbsp; The pilot lets go of the deployment bag and stalls the wing so 
	it will not down-plane and increase his descent rate.&nbsp; However, he 
	would have had a slower descent rate if he had used a B-line stall rather 
	than pull the brakes.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yByGAiMd4EM">RESERVE DEPLOYMENT 
	II</a>  –  An actual reserve deployment at an SIV clinic.&nbsp; The pilot was 
	doing acrobatics that went awry. Note how long it takes for the reserve to 
	inflate – a result of poor packing or lack of force in the deployment.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/tOZEgKXJMCE&hl=en&fs=1">ENERGY</a>  –  
	Expert test pilot and flight instructor Bob Hoover on converting energy from 
	plenty of airspeed into maneuverability.&nbsp; Both PG &amp; PPG pilots need to 
	practice exactly what he does (minus the loops and rolls).&nbsp; Coming in 
	for a landing with plenty of energy is good.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfCK5GyK7D8">SIDE HILL LANDING
	</a> –  How to do a side hill landing</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BM2OXeZbecs">GOOD KITING SKILLS</a> 
	 –  Kiting at Kilbourne Hole maar.&nbsp; The pilot stays directly beneath the 
	wing at all times by using the brakes.&nbsp; The better a pilot gets at 
	kiting, the less he has to work keeping himself under the wing.&nbsp; Note 
	his bent knees.</p>
