				<font size="4">Woods Hole Massachusetts  –  A Powered Paragliding Paradise on 
				the Ocean</font><p>A beautiful mix of bays, harbors, fresh and 
				saltwater ponds and marshes, and islands  –  this sparsely populated region can 
				provide a powered paraglider pilot with stunning sea and 
				landscapes.&nbsp; Woods Hole is situated on the southern tip 
				on Cape Cod.&nbsp; The hole itself is a small but important 
				passage between 
				Vineyard Sound and Buzzards Bay and has a strong tidal current 
				that reach in excess of (7) knots.&nbsp; The narrow passage is one 
				of the most dangerous on the east coast with many boats going 
				aground on the rocks each year.<p>Woods Hole with (L-R) Buzzards 
				Bay, Mill Pond, Eel Pond, and Great Harbor. View is east.&nbsp; 
				The launch/LZ is the ballpark in the upper left.<br>

				Weepecket Islands  –  they are uninhabited but for the birds and

				<br>
				Nonamesset Island (upper middle) and the Woods Hole passage.&nbsp; 
				A few boats can be seen but the visible whitewater is caused by 
				the tide rushing through this narrow spot.&nbsp; The little 
				islands of Devils Foot Island (L) and Ram Island (R) can be seen 
				adjacent to Great Harbor where many boats are moored.&nbsp; In 
				the lower part of the photo are the docks (L-R) of the Steamship 
				Authority, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, and the Marine 
				Biological Laboratory.<br>

				Looking east along Tarpaulin Cove  –  one of the safest and most 
				protected coves along the Elizabeth Islands.&nbsp; This is 
				because of its deep water and shelter from the storms coming 
				from the southwest to the northeast.&nbsp; It used be the depot 
				where U.S. mail was exchanged with great ships that were in the 
				region.&nbsp; These days it is just an infrequent tourist 
				destination.<br>
