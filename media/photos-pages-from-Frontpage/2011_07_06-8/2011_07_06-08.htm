				<p><font size="2"><b>July 6-8  –  Aden Volcanic Field </b> –  Bill 
				Cummings and yours truly (Had Robinson) managed to get away for 
				a few days to fly the beauty and vastness of the Field which is 
				located in south central New Mexico.&nbsp; We stayed near an old 
				cinder quarry approximately 1.5 miles WNW of Aden Mountain 
				(32.141260°&nbsp; -107.127264°).&nbsp; Most everything has been 
				brown for at least 10 months in the following photos but we are 
				entering the monsoon season and we should have some moisture 
				which will make the entire area briefly green.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2">An evening flight over the Field.&nbsp; In the far 
		distance (18 miles away to the south) are the three peaks of Mt. Riley, 
		Cox, and No-Name.&nbsp; To their left is the (just visible) East 
		Potrillo Mountain chain.<br>

		</font></p>
		<p><font size="2">Our home for three days.&nbsp; This cone was heavily 
		mined for its lava cinders (red and black) decades ago.&nbsp; The sharp 
		east face provided a shady refuge from the sun late in the day.&nbsp; I 
		was able to park my RV trailer close to the base of it.&nbsp; In the 
		late of the day, dust devils would tear through here, even throwing my 
		paramotor so hard against my back window that it broke it!<br>
		</font>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_0686.JPG" width="1024" height="575"></p>
		<p><font size="2">Despite the drought, there are creatures that can 
		obviously live on the dry and sparse vegetation that is out there, 
		including this Jack Rabbit.&nbsp; I was able to get amazingly close to 
		this one.&nbsp; Perhaps he had never before seen a human being <i>
		&quot;What's this biped thing?&nbsp; Not a hawk, coyote, or eagle.&nbsp; 
		Maybe it's related to cattle?&quot;</i>&nbsp; The lava of the field is 
		plainly visible on the ground.&nbsp; In the three days we were there, we 
		never saw or heard a coyote.<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC00719.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></font></p>
		<p><font size="2">Bill surveys the east side of the Aden Hills for a 
		possible training area for paragliding and hang gliding.&nbsp; The 
		gentle slope goes down for a 1/4 mile or more with no obstacles at the 
		bottom.&nbsp; The Hills are a high point in the area and are populated 
		with microwave relay stations.<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC00714.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></font></p>
		<p><font size="2">An ancient (but well made) paved road that went west 
		to the cinder cone we stayed at.<br>
		</font>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC00717.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p><font size="2">The vast region is a delight to fly over, especially 
		10' off the ground like a cruise missile.&nbsp; We always ask ourselves, 
		&quot;Is this earth???&quot;<br>
		</font>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC00738.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p><font size="2">Unpopulated and remote areas of the southwest are 
		often used as corridors to smuggle both people and drugs from Mexico.&nbsp; 
		Of course, our activities drew a lot of attention from the ever-vigilant 
		U.S. Border Patrol.&nbsp; This sharp-eyed agent saw me pop up into the 
		air and then disappear down low but followed me for miles.&nbsp; The 
		cartels use ultralights to transport their loads north so our presence 
		had to be carefully investigated.&nbsp; As we do not usually fly in this 
		sector of the southwest, we were unknown.&nbsp; We know have a special 
		number that we call if we plan to operate in this area.&nbsp; The Patrol 
		has a dangerous and tough job and, as responsible citizens, we need to 
		help them.&nbsp; I handed out many business cards to the agents as PPG 
		would be an ideal way to inexpensively and easily patrol many square 
		miles of the mountainous desert.&nbsp; The cost of operation of a foot 
		launched system would be about the same as an ATV.<br>
		</font>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC00741.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p><font size="2">Another group of agents paid us a visit.&nbsp; These 
		guys get paid to ride ATV's! The next step:&nbsp; Get paid to fly PPG.<br>
		</font>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC00763.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p><font size="2">The drought is tough on even the insects.&nbsp; Honey 
		bees quickly smelled the occasional splash of water we made so we set 
		out a bowl of water for them.&nbsp; These bees consumed over a pint 
		every hour!&nbsp; The hive must have been close to here.&nbsp; The 
		nearest other water is at the Johnson Ranch about 5 miles SE of us  –  a 
		long way for a bee to travel.&nbsp; We put the empty soda can out to 
		help them find the water.&nbsp; Bees can see color and we didn't want 
		them exploring out camp site too much....<br>
		</font>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC00742.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p><font size="2">Another one of the many cones in the area.&nbsp; I was 
		able to ridge soar this one late in the day.&nbsp; The air was coming in 
		at about 11 and provided just enough lift to stay up without power.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>

		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC00745.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p><font size="2">The Southern Pacific railroad has their main east-west 
		track just east of the Field.&nbsp; It's a lonely stretch of track.<br>
		</font>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC00756.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p><font size="2">The Johnson Ranch  –  we didn't count but 10 cattle in 
		the area as the drought has been severe.&nbsp; Ranches are sparse out 
		here.&nbsp; It is a lonely existence to be sure but peaceful.&nbsp; It 
		is located about 13 miles north of Riley, Cox, and No-Name which can be 
		seen to the south.<br>
