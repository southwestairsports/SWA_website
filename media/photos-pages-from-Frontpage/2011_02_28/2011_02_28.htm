		<font size="4">February 28 Monday  –  Off the Grid Again...(or, out west 
		of the East Potrillo Mountains)</font><p>Our heroes at the National 
		Weather Service sent up the weather balloon at 5AM this morning and gave 
		us a look-see at the atmosphere for the day  –  all completely cool for 
		flying safely at most any altitude. The atmosphere, as we would expect 
		after the passing of a strong front, was thoroughly loosened up. The Jet 
		was overhead and probably would give us little more than a few flutters 
		because of the multiple inversions going up through the atmosphere. I 
		(Had Robinson) decided to explore the west face of the E. Potrillo 
		Mountains in south central New Mexico. I drove west on Hwy 9 about 17 
		miles with my equipment and parked near the highway on the dirt road 
		going up the east side of the E. Potrillo Mountains.</p>
		<p>The US Border Patrol stopped by and I gave them my card and asked the 
		agent to notify the shift supervisor as to what I was doing (a safety 
		precaution when we are less than a mile from a dangerous border).&nbsp; 
		I have encountered heavily armed military troops out here in the middle 
		of the night so one can't be too careful....</p>
		<p>I set up on the dirt road, facing into the weak SSE breeze and took 
		off using the Miniplane Top 80 foot launched paramotor with the APCO 
		Karma SP for the glider.&nbsp; The Top 80 weighs about what your average 
		backpack weighs for an overnight campout  –  not bad for launching an 
		aircraft.</p>
		<p>Here is a view (never taken before) of the E. Potrillo Mountains with 
		the Three Sisters in the background:&nbsp; (L-R) Mt. Cox, Mt. No-Name, 
		and Mt. Riley.&nbsp; It's all a vast desert wilderness more remote than 
		most places in the lower 48 states.<br>

		<p>A view of the Three Sisters with the W. Potrillo Mountains and the 
		Little Floridas in the far left distance.<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_5985.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>Here is a view from the west of half way up the range.&nbsp; The 
		arrow points to the Torrey Paso launch site (thanks, Lee Boone) that 
		sits at the south end of a saddle in the range.&nbsp; The light colored 
		area is a water tank that we use as an LZ.&nbsp; The Organ Mountains are 
		in the distance to the left and the Franklin Mountains are to the right.&nbsp; 
		The deep canyons on the west face of these mountains makes soaring the 
		west side not so appealing  –  winds can become tricky as they blow 
		through these cracks in the rocks.<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_5986.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>The dark and menacing Mt. Cox  –  it has never been flown because 
		there are no trails to the top and no roads near the base.&nbsp; I and 
		some others have hiked to the top and it would be a grand site if it 
		were more accessible.&nbsp; The West Potrillo lava field, the Little 
		Florida Mountains (R), and the widely scattered ranges of the Coronado 
		National Forest in southeastern Arizona (S) are all visible here.&nbsp; 
		This is dark sky country at night and one of the quietest places I have 
		ever been on earth (other than the bottom of caves).<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_5990.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>Our majestic Rt. Riley  –  I had just entered the house thermal south 
		of the peak. Lift was strong, wide, and smooth.&nbsp; I had left all of 
		my flying instruments at home  –  completely forgot them.&nbsp; I was 
		flying, by feel only, a few hundred feet below the summit of Riley when 
		I ventured SSW of the peak for fun.&nbsp; Like magic, I entered the 
		house thermal which lives about a mile south of the peak and went way 
		up.&nbsp; As it was getting late and I was getting really cold, I had to 
		leave it (sniff...)&nbsp; I think it would have gone up at least another 
		1,000'  –  to the bottom of the next inversion in the atmosphere.&nbsp; 
		Had I had my vertical speed indicator and my GPS, I would have attempted 
		a top landing  –  it's never been done.&nbsp; But to do that sort of 
		thing, a pilot must know precisely the wind direction and speed, 
		especially the former.&nbsp; I was pretty sure what was going on but the 
		Potrillo Mountains are near the Continental Divide and weather can be 
		quite different on the west and east sides, as I later discovered that 
		day!&nbsp; In the left distance are the dark volcanic cones of the 
		Potrillo Volcanic Field.<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_5991.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>I flew from Riley south back to Hwy 9 (visible here).&nbsp; Right 
		beyond is another of the maars in our area but this one is in Mexico.&nbsp; 
		It is bigger than Kilbourne Hole but not as deep.&nbsp; The view from 
		space of this maar is pronounced.&nbsp; I probably could have crossed 
		the border and landed in the maar but who would greet me?&nbsp; How 
		would I get back into the States?&nbsp; It's a 17 mile walk to the 
		border crossing.&nbsp; What would I say to the officials of both sides?&nbsp; 
		It would be an adventure  –  probably just a very long walk  –  but I have 
		a family and many dear friends....<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_5994.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>Another view of the west face of the E. Potrillo Mountains.&nbsp; 
		This side is much higher than the east side.&nbsp; Surprisingly, the air 
		was westerly on this side and southerly on the east though never more 
		than 5 mph or so, both sides.<br>

		<p>I hope you enjoyed the show  –  it's a beautiful wilderness out there 
		that shows the best from a paraglider!</p></td>
