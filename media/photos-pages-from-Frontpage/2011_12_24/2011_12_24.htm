				<p><b>December 24 Saturday  –  Snow Magic</b>  –  I (Had Robinson) 
				was able to fly PPG the day after we had a few inches of snow 
				and cold weather in the Franklin Mountains.&nbsp; Clouds were 
				covering the entire region at an elevation of about 6,500' MSL.&nbsp; 
				There were one or two&nbsp; holes in the cover and one is 
				visible in the photo below  –  I am headed right for it with 
				plans to fly through it (safely) into the blue sky above.&nbsp; 
				The view is northeast with the summit of N. Mount Franklin 
				(middle left) completely hidden by the clouds.&nbsp; The road 
				visible is the western half of Transmountain Road (SR 375) which 
				goes over the pass.</p>

		<p><font size="2">Here I have just flown through the hole and did a 180 
		degree turn so I could look back down.&nbsp; I wanted to be sure that I 
		did not lose the hole in the clouds.&nbsp; If I did, I would not be able 
		to descend as I would not be able to see where I am going.&nbsp; The 
		clouds are dynamic.&nbsp; They move (although slowly) and I not only did 
		not want to lose the location of the hole but I also had to be sure that 
		it was not closing up!&nbsp; So far, so good.&nbsp; It was VERY cold up 
		here and I did not linger as my hands were frozen  –  even with heaters 
		 –  nor did I not wish to lose my descent route back to earth.<br>
		</font>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC01538.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p><font size="2">Keeping the hole in view, I continue my ascent above 
		the clouds.&nbsp; I was concerned that the hole might close (being so 
		near the mountains) and, if it did, I might be forced to descend through 
		them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there is rarely any air traffic near 
		the mountains, it would certainly be a surprise to make some blunder and 
		run into them while descending.&nbsp; Although a GPS is 100% reliable, 
		what if a pilot experiences cascading events:&nbsp; An engine out, 
		batteries go dead, etc.?&nbsp; This is what safe pilots strive to avoid:&nbsp; 
		Multiple failures/mistakes that can seriously compromise safety.<br>

		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC01541.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p><font size="2">Time to go back down through the worm-hole from one 
		world back to another.&nbsp; The hole was changing the entire time  –  
		but I was watching it intently.<br>
		</font>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC01544.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p><font size="2">I flew west a few miles and found another hole in the 
		clouds.&nbsp; This one was bigger and and more defined and had towering 
		edges.&nbsp; I could not resist going up again.&nbsp; The photo here is 
		about half way through.&nbsp; The clouds are only a few hundred feet 
		thick.&nbsp; Remember that a paraglider is only going 20 mph so we can 
		really see things clearly and easily and do little to disturb the 
		airspace.<br>
		</font>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC01552.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p><font size="2">One side of the hole had quite a tall cloud.&nbsp; I 
		am about 250 meters from it and still going up into the blue sky above.<br>
		</font>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC01558.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p><font size="2">With the hole behind me, I turned west and faced the 
		sun shining on the layer of clouds.&nbsp; The cloud to my left is but 10 
		yards away.<br>
		</font>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC01559.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p><font size="2">It was a surreal &quot;cloudscape&quot;  –  and worth being 
		bitterly cold to see it.<br>
		</font>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC01562.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p><font size="2">I then did a 180 turn and headed back to the hole, 
		having to first fly over the cloud in the lower middle of this photo.&nbsp; 
		The cloud cover was beginning to dissipate because of a high pressure 
		system in the region.&nbsp; Everything was sinking (temperature of the 
		air was rising and becoming more dense) and the clouds were being 
		re-absorbed into the atmosphere.<br>
		</font>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC01564.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p><font size="2">I did another 180 turn and then began a spiral descent 
		through the hole, keeping right to the edge of it.<br>
		</font>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC01565.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p><font size="2">As I was turning, I noted this is interesting halo.&nbsp; 
		It is formed in the same way as a rainbow.&nbsp; The sun was shining 
		through the tens of millions of tiny spheres of moisture that make up a 
		cloud and the image was projected on the surface of another cloud.&nbsp; 
		The distance from the spheres to the projected area is not more than a 
		1,000 meters.&nbsp; The cloud out front has to be just the right 
		thickness for enough sun to penetrate it and another cloud must be in 
		the exact position to reflect the image.&nbsp; I had never seen anything 
		like this before nor read about it in text books.&nbsp; It would only be 
		visible from a balloon or a paraglider as anything else would be moving 
		too fast to see it or would disturb the clouds.&nbsp; I am not sure why 
		there is an inner, lighter circular area  –  maybe some physicist out 
		there will know why?&nbsp; The round nature of the image proves that 
		cloud particles are spherical and not some other shape.&nbsp; On the 
		other hand, maybe it was a real worm-hole into another universe?&nbsp; 
		If I had just flown right to it...next time.<br>

		<p>I was frozen and it was time to come down and go to the Christmas Eve 
		service.&nbsp; I hope you enjoyed the show!</p></td>
