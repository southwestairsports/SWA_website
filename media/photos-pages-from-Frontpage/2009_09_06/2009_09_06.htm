		<p>Riley is the taller peak in the middle.&nbsp; Note the heavy storms 
		over the area - they all dissipated after a few hours.&nbsp; The Three 
		Sisters (Riley, Cox, and No-Name) are giant thermal generators and air 
		over this area is always going up which is why there are so many storms 
		here.<br>

		<p>Grady Viramontes (P2) and his instructor, Had Robinson, ventured out 
		to the middle of nowhere for a first<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; color: #282A55"> 
		– Grady is the first native born, native trained PG pilot to fly Mt. 
		Riley.&nbsp; </span>Conditions were mild that 
		afternoon with a weak NE breeze.&nbsp; In the photo below Mt. Cox is 
		visible in the background.&nbsp; Our trucks are parked around the base 
		of Riley to the left (out of sight here).<br>
		<img border="0" src="DSC02087.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>We are finally at the top!&nbsp; Had's mountain wing weighed 15 lbs. 
		and Grady's gear weighed 55 lbs - this is why Had is smiling more...<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; color: #282A55">but 
		such is life when you are the junior pilot!</span><br>
		<img border="0" src="DSC02090.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>The hike to the top was about 40 minutes from the access road that is 
		about 1/2 way to the top on the west side.&nbsp; This is a &quot;<i>hike-'n-fly</i>&quot; 
		mountain in a remote area of south central New Mexico = dark sky, no 
		services, no power lines, not much....&nbsp; The top of Riley is ideal 
		for PG/HG launch as there are no obstructions of any kind -- just a smooth 
		cone with grass and small rocks at the summit.&nbsp; This peak had a 
		small jar with a notebook for visitors to give the date and their names.&nbsp; 
		Hopefully, an ambitious hang glider pilot (Robin Hastings?) will be the 
		first to fly from the top (we'll get a crew to haul up the glider).<br>
		<img border="0" src="DSC02091.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>Grady did a forward launch about 6:00 PM as the breeze was not more 
		than about 2 mph and sometimes it was calm.&nbsp; As a P2 about to have 
		his first mountain launch, the lateness of the day made sure that the 
		air was not turbulent.&nbsp; The view below is to the NE -- a few water 
		tanks out there and that's it.&nbsp; The whole region is quiet, 
		peaceful, and beautiful.&nbsp; What a privilege to fly out into the air 
		in such a place as this!<br>
		<img border="0" src="DSC02092.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>View of the summit looking south.&nbsp; Mt. Cox is to the right and 
		the East Potrillo Mountains are to the left.<br>
		<img border="0" src="PICT0020.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>Grady is soaring out in front of the summit with the East Potrillo 
		Mountains to the left distance.<br>
		<img border="0" src="PICT0081.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>Grady was able to safely soar the windward face of Riley about 10 
		minutes before he headed for the alluvial plain which surrounds the 
		mountain.<br>
		<img border="0" src="DSC02095.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The wind changed from NE to east and then Had launched in light winds 
		around 7PM.&nbsp; He was able to soar the face until dark.&nbsp; The 
		pointed shadow seen in the photo below is of Mt. Riley.<br>
		<img border="0" src="DSC02104.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>There was enough of a breeze to allow a pilot to soar above the 
		summit of Mt. Riley.&nbsp; The East Potrillo Mountains are visible in 
		the upper left in the photo below.&nbsp; If there was more time before 
		dark, we could have jumped across the gap and soared the east face of 
		this range for many miles.&nbsp; However, such an adventure requires a 
		ground crew to pick up the pilots -- which we did not have this time.<br>
		<img border="0" src="DSC02113.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>In the photo below:&nbsp; Mt. Riley (foreground), Mt. No-Name 
		(center), and the West Potrillo Mountains (rear).<br>
		<img border="0" src="DSC02126.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>It was getting dark and we had to come down.&nbsp; Both pilots safely 
		landed and walked back to where their trucks were parked (the area that 
		is to the center left of the photo above).&nbsp; Grady just landed below 
		- in the one of the biggest LZ's in the USA.<br>
