		<b>June 16, 2009 Soaring at Kilbourne Hole Maar</b><p>Pilots Had 
		Robinson and Lee Boone ventured out Tuesday to fly the maar in the late 
		afternoon.&nbsp; All of the forecasts said that the air would be around 
		8 from the SW, changing to the WNW around 6 PM. </p>
		<p>We got there and it was averaging over 18 -- too much to fly in.&nbsp; 
		The air mellowed and Had launched from the east rim (visible in the 
		photo below) and immediately got strong lift -- as high and as far out 
		in front as anyone has ever been (200'+ over launch).&nbsp; For five 
		minutes it was strong air and then it began to get turbulent.&nbsp; </p>
		<p>As good pilots, when the air gets horsey, you get high for safety.&nbsp; 
		Sure enough, the area south of launch which was huge lift now became 
		huge sink so it was good to be out front and high so you could choose 
		your LZ.</p>
		<p>The sudden presence of sink is what happens when the air switches 
		from SW to NW.&nbsp; Because the launch site is a point that sticks out 
		into the maar, it is easy to launch in winds as much as 160 degrees 
		difference.&nbsp; The downside is that if you are flying low on the 
		upwind side of launch and there is a wind shift, you can get caught in 
		air that is going down.&nbsp; The safety aspect is that all wind quickly 
		dies down the lower you go in the maar.&nbsp; This is generally not 
		the case anywhere else.&nbsp; So, air that is going down rapidly becomes 
		air that isn't doing anything = a safe landing.</p>
		<p>The pilot found a spot where the mesquite was more distant apart and 
		landed.&nbsp; However, the air still was shifting a little and his 
		glider wound up in some bushes (not mesquite!).&nbsp; </p>
		<p><b>Kilbourne Hole Maar sink out </b>-- Here is what happens when you 
		fly in air that's changing directions -- you sink out!&nbsp; A few 
		minutes ago, the pilot was happily flying 500' above the ground and then 
		-- wham -- the wind changed and this area south of launch (the rim far 
		in the distance) became air that was going down!&nbsp; It was a nice 
		hike back to the top.&nbsp; The wind became steady an hour later and 
		soaring the Maar became perfect!<br>

		<p>Had the pilot had just 4' more, he would have missed the creosote 
		bush.&nbsp; But all was well -- landing in the bushes is part of living 
		in some of the most amazing flying country in the world.&nbsp; We pretty 
		much have this region to ourselves -- it's pretty remote 
		and off the grid.&nbsp; Cell phones do work at launch because of the 
		altitude but nowhere else.<br>
		<img border="0" src="DSC01695.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		Below is an image of the first flight.&nbsp; It's easy 
		to see how horsey the air was and how there was super lift one minute 
		and then super sink the next.&nbsp; We would not fly in these conditions 
		(expecting a wind direction/weather change in the mountains but here it 
		is a different story because of the protection from wind below the lip 
		of the maar.&nbsp; Check the next image for how flying is when the air 
		settles down.&nbsp; It is quite a difference.<br>

		Below is why soaring a maar is so much fun!&nbsp; It is 
		one of the few inland sites in the US where pilots can consistently 
		easily top-land without the danger of rotor or turbulence.&nbsp; The 
		face of the maar is gentle as well as the back.&nbsp; The pilot here 
		flew until it was almost 8:30PM.&nbsp; Who knows what we might do on a 
		moonlit night???
