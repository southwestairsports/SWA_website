				<font size="7" face="Castellar">VALLE DE BRAVO 2012</font><p>
				<span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif"><b>December 3 - 8
				</b> –  Thermalling is the skill everyone learns here as there 
				are plenty of strong thermals that can take pilots over a mile 
				into the air.&nbsp; An important extra is the Mexican ambience 
				rarely found by ordinary tourists  –  the friendly people and the 
				geography of the mountainous central areas of Mexico.</span></p>
				<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif">Below, the 
				famous El Pe</span><font face="Verdana">ñ</font><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif">on.&nbsp; 
				This towering rocky peak is a great source of thermals for 
				pilots.&nbsp; The view is north from a fertile mesa that is at 
				it's foot.</span></p>
				<p>

				<p>A crowded day above the main launch with over (30) 
				paragliders and hang gliders in the air.&nbsp; View is north 
				east.&nbsp; El Pe<font face="Verdana">ñon is to the left of the 
				photo about a mile.</font></p>
				<p>

				<p>The El Torre launch just east of the town of Valle de Bravo.&nbsp; 
				This is a difficult launch because of the trees on either side 
				and the steep ramp.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_1222.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
				<p>However, La Torre is perfect for lawn darts  –  as seen below.&nbsp; 
				Kip from Maine is the pilot.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_1224.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
				<p>After boating around mountains behind Valle for a few hours, 
				pilots have to land at the little square here.&nbsp; Landing 
				skills are important!&nbsp; A red paraglider can just be seen at 
				the tip of the arrow.&nbsp; In wet years, this postage stamp of 
				an LZ is all there is.&nbsp; Everything else is under water.&nbsp; 
				It is not hard to set up  –  and why a visit with the local 
				pilots first is a good idea.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_1238.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
				<p>If a pilot gets really high, he can fly out over the lake, as 
				here, and enjoy some stunning views of this little town in the 
				mountains.&nbsp; The LZ is just to the right of the VB Yacht 
				Club.</p>

				The main LZ late in the afternoon.&nbsp; Pe<font face="Verdana">ñon 
				is to the left and the main launch is just visible in the upper 
				right.</font></p>

				The top of El Pe<font face="Verdana">ñon  –  a glider is just 
				visible going up near cloud base.</font></p>

				<p>When a pilot lands, he has plenty of time  –  waiting to get 
				picked up.&nbsp; There are no animals around except cows, 
				horses, dogs, and a few birds.&nbsp; There are very few flies 
				and virtually no mosquitoes.&nbsp; The land is volcanic in 
				origin and incredibly rich.&nbsp; Native corn grows thick and is 
				not attacked by bugs or deer (there are none here).&nbsp; But 
				there are occasional things of beauty in the bug department, 
				like this garden spider...</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_1252.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
				<p>An LZ known as Las Pe<font face="Verdana">ñitas.&nbsp; Note 
				the grass  –  thick and green and a great place to nap.</font></p>
				<p>

				<p>A neighbor of the spider above.&nbsp; These creatures are the 
				ones that spin amazing and beautiful webs.&nbsp; Some of their 
				stringers can stretch a span of (10) yards.&nbsp; I walked into 
				one of these webs and it was not 5 minutes until the spider got 
				back to work (America take note...).</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_20121205_114924.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
				<p>The common Morning Glory  –  with a honey bee and some other 
				small bugs.&nbsp; Flowers depend on the bugs to spread genetic 
				material around.</p>

				<p>View of El Pe<font face="Verdana">ñon from above launch.&nbsp; 
				Behind it is &quot;The Wall&quot;  –  a place of more crazy thermals.</font></p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_1264.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
				<p>It's late in the day  –  the mist is thick and the air boaty.&nbsp; 
				It is such a contrast from the air of our home in the southwest 
				U.S. The shiny things in the lower right are ponds reflecting 
				the setting sun.&nbsp; This place has water and soil like few 
				other places.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_1273.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
				<p>It's time to land  –  it's important to be able to see the LZ.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_1284.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
				<p>This modest road sign marks the restaurant that every pilot 
				from all over the world loves.&nbsp; The lady who runs it did 
				something that works in every language:&nbsp; Bring the 
				customers into the kitchen and let them pick out their dish.&nbsp; 
				No surprises!&nbsp; With fresh tortillas made on the location 
				and locally grown vegetables, it is the place of choice.&nbsp; 
				Then there is the price<span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:
minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>–
				</span>under $5 for a huge multi-course meal.&nbsp; 
				Of course, the food is delicious.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_20121206_144204.jpg" width="768" height="1024"></p>
				<p>Organically grown corn.&nbsp; The soil is so rich the farmers 
				don't have to till the soil  –  the weeds grow alongside the 
				corn.&nbsp; When you have tortillas, you don't need bread.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_20121206_180653.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
				<p>If you get REALLY high over La Torre launch, you can fly out 
				over the lake with plenty of altitude to spare, as I did here.&nbsp; 
				I beat my own record by finding some tractor-beam from outer 
				space to get to 8,000' MSL over this soaring site in the late 
				afternoon.&nbsp; Want to retire here?&nbsp; For about $600/month 
				you get a villa on the water with a cook, maid, and a gardener.&nbsp; 
				I am tempted....</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_1294.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
				<p>My hotel room looking out.&nbsp; Fresh flowers are put 
				everywhere.&nbsp; The Mexicans have art in their blood.&nbsp; 
				They don't build anything without making it a thing of beauty  –  
				even the town streets are cobble and hand-shaped.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_20121207_083426.jpg" width="768" height="1024"></p>
				<p>An inviting garden within the walls of the little hotel where 
				I am staying.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_20121207_084227.jpg" width="768" height="1024"></p>
				<p>Last but not least, the Norwegians (30 of them) visited Valle 
				this year to fly.&nbsp; Here they are lounging around in the 
				main LZ below the Pe<font face="Verdana">ñon launch.&nbsp;
				</font>They have the most women pilots.&nbsp; The Germans had 
				zero and we had two.&nbsp; The woman in the pink shirt is a 
				beginner and had a huge collapse flying out in front of launch 
				 –  she has kept flying and was not scared out of the sport.&nbsp; 
				Her bravery is commendable.&nbsp; Every week, we have several 
				reserve parachute tosses by pilots flying in air way above their 
				skill level on twitchy gliders.&nbsp; So far, no one has been 
				hurt and everyone has had way too much fun.&nbsp; More later....&nbsp;
