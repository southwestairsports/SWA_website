	<h1>Mennonite Wedding -- Buenaventura, Chih., Mexico</h1>
	<p>Mennonite Wedding (and potential flying region) -- Buenaventura, Chih., 
	Mexico<br><br>Marilyn &amp; I were privileged to be invited to the wedding of 
	one of our pilots, Fredy Neufeld and (now) his new bride Helena.&nbsp; I had 
	brought my wing along in hopes to fly some of the territory in this part of 
	the state of Chihuahua but it was raining pretty much the whole time.<br>
	<br>Fredy is from the Mexican Mennonite colony just north of Cuauhtémoc city 
	in Chihuahua state, Mexico.&nbsp; Helena is from another colony of 
	Mennonites, Buenaventura (30.099000° -107.334600°)&nbsp; that is about two 
	hours north of Cuauhtémoc in a remote area WSW of the town of Villa Ahumada, 
	the location of the wedding and pictured here.&nbsp; This area of Mexico, 
	like southern New Mexico, is high desert but it gets at least twice as much 
	rain as we usually do during the year.&nbsp; Marilyn and I were two of the 
	four foreigners who were invited to the celebration.&nbsp; The region has 
	never been flown by anything.&nbsp; There are plenty of low mountains, 
	mostly covered with grass, that would be ideal for training/flying for hang 
	gliding or paragliding.&nbsp; Cross country would be an adventure.<br><br>
	Headed down the toll road in open country southwest of Juarez.&nbsp; It is 
	not a particularly busy road with great views of ranch country.</p>

	<br>The dunes of Salamayuca -- a national park south of Juarez.<br><br><br>
	<br>Southwest of Villa Ahumada -- the foothills of the Sierra Madre are in 
	the distance.<br><br><br><br>Hotel el Valle -- the only hotel in the region. 
	Owner is Abraham Enns. Rooms were perfectly neat and clean.<br><br><br><br>
	The hills around Colonia el Valle. They surround the 100 square mile 
	agricultural area. Water was everywhere....<br><br><br><br>The reception 
	hall/gym next to the church<br><br><br><br><br><br>The Mennonite church 
	where Fredy &amp; Helena married.<br><br><br><br>Everyone spoke low German, 
	Spanish, and English. There were many relatives who came from Alberta, 
	Canada.<br><br><br><br>The newlyweds are playing the popular shoe-game. You 
	get asked a question and then stick a shoe up of yours or your spouse in 
	answer.<br><br><br><br>The happy couple at the reception where everyone 
	shared a sit down meal<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The wedding 
	group - bride, groom, bridesmaids, and groomsmen.<br><br><br><br>Fredy, his 
	parents, and two sisters (one of which is getting married herself soon).<br>
	<br><br><br>The new couple, Marilyn, and yours truly<br><br><br><br>The 
	entire weekend it was dark sky with rain. The land was soaked. The crops of 
	cotton and maize loved it....<br><br><br><br>It's wonderful watching clouds 
	that actually dump that wet stuff.<br><br><br><br>The cotton was 4' high<br>
	<br><br><br>The farmers dug these trenches through the farmland to drain the 
	torrents that occasionally come out of the mountains -- as here.<br><br><br>
	<br>South of the colonia looking into the hills -- nice HG or PG country 
	(when not raining)<br><br><br><br>Some of the 60 sq. mi. of amazing farmland 
	in the high desert<br><br><br><br><br><br>It is called "mud" -- this variety 
	is full of clay = 4 wheel drive country ONLY<br><br><br><br>Salamayuca Dune 
	Fields 15 miles south of Juarez, Chih., Mexico<br><br><br><br>Marilyn and 
	yours truly -- imagine being able to drive around White Sands? It does not 
	hurt anything -- wait a few weeks and every track is covered.&nbsp; I am 
	sorry to say that environmentalism has become extreme in the United States.<br>
	<br><br><br><br><br>The verdant mountains northeast of the dune field.<br>
	<br><br><br>If we had the time, we would have visited the high dunes in the 
	distance -- good for PG, I think.<br><br><br><br>Hope you enjoyed the show!<br>
	<br><br></p>
