				<p><b>June 14 Thursday  –  The Days are Just Packed</b>  –  Being 
				that this time of year is synonymous with goofy air, we take 
				what we can get.&nbsp; Then there are times when we get more 
				than we think - or deserve.&nbsp; Make no mistake, the thermals 
				during late spring, summer, and early fall are ballistic for us 
				paragliders during most of the day.&nbsp; But, occasionally we 
				have exceptions to the rules, especially freedom from high winds 
				aloft  –  today was one of them as late spring tends to be really 
				turbulent around here.&nbsp; Being that our other PG gung-ho 
				local pilot, LB, had to w*rk, I (Had Robinson) was on my own.&nbsp; 
				Starting just before 7PM, there was good steady air from the WSW 
				at 12 mph which makes the Franklin Mountains the real &quot;Magic 
				Kingdom.&quot;</p>
		<p>Below, the increasing moisture creeping in from the southeast is 
		evident.&nbsp; Though we do not have the vistas as usual, it is a 
		pleasant change.&nbsp; The pilot here is about 1/2 mile west of the 
		summit of N. Mt. Franklin looking north.&nbsp; The Organ Mountains are 
		barely visible in the distance.&nbsp; Smooth and steady lift was 
		everywhere!</p>

		<p>Southwest of the N. Mt. Franklin summit, the pilot must work hard to 
		bench up out of the slower air.&nbsp; Once above 6,500' MSL or so, the 
		winds aloft are the same day or night.&nbsp; Below this elevation, they 
		quickly die down at the end of the day due to the creation of the daily 
		inversion which isolates this lower air from that higher.&nbsp; However, 
		this pilot did not work too hard getting back up because he had a 
		paramotor which could be started and provided what the diminishing winds 
		could not:&nbsp; Lift! </p>

		<p>Flying to the
		<a href="../../../../SiteInfo/Agave/agave.htm#Benching_up_from_The_Triangle:">
		Triangle</a>, he encountered the amazing lift which, without any sort of 
		external power, always gets us up to the top of the range.&nbsp; The 
		photo below is just south of the summit of N. Mt. Franklin.&nbsp; The 
		air about 1/4 mile to the right (or west) is the &quot;sweet spot&quot; of the 
		range.&nbsp; Here thermals and lift combine into a single stream that 
		goes  –  up!&nbsp; It is a band of lift that is wide and very easy to 
		stay in.</p>

		<p>A view out in front of N. Mt. Franklin looking east.&nbsp; The white 
		speck is an Amateur Radio Repeater hosted by the West Texas Repeater 
		Association.&nbsp; The frequency (input) is 146.88 MHz. Solar powered, 
		it has an amazing range - about 70 miles in every direction.</p>

		<p>The photo below is the same as the one two above but taken just 
		before dusk.&nbsp; It is a striking view being in the mountains at this 
		time of day.&nbsp; It is hard to describe what it is like  –  gliding 
		along in silky smooth air with only the rush of air.&nbsp; There were 
		vultures and swifts soaring above the peak and their cries were easy to 
		hear.&nbsp; But it was time to land and it takes a while to get down and 
		you have to plan on it so you do not have to land in the dark.</p>
