		<font size="2"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif">Lee Baker 
		and Had Robinson went out to check these mountains for their potential 
		for soaring with air from the west.&nbsp; We started at the south of the 
		range and worked north about a mile.&nbsp; Our first stop was the south 
		launch (visible
		<a href="../../../../SiteInfo/EastPotrilloMtns/BCLaunchSouth.kmz">here</a> 
		on Google Earth).&nbsp; (We have renamed it &quot;BC Launch South&quot; in honor 
		of Bill Cummings who is the one that told us about this hitherto unknown 
		launch site.)</span></font></p>

		<font size="2"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif">BC 
		Launch South (where our trucks are parked). The plain east of the 
		mountains is over 200' lower than the plain on the west face which makes 
		all east facing sites better for launching (another 200' of ground 
		clearance).&nbsp; View here is SSE.&nbsp; There was a nice breeze 
		through the area from the west.<br>

		<p><font size="2">Below is a test mine we found up in the mountains from 
		50-75 years ago.&nbsp; The black arrows point to a vein of milky white 
		quartz that ran from the surface down into the earth.&nbsp; This was 
		apparently what prompted a miner to return with equipment to follow the 
		vein  –  which can contain gold.&nbsp; Here are some
		<a href="http://www.galleries.com/minerals/silicate/milky_qu/milky_qu.htm">
		comments</a> on this:&nbsp; &quot;Milky quartz is occasionally associated 
		with gold in hydrothermal veins. Prospectors searching for gold laden 
		ore look for outcrops of milky white quartz veins.&nbsp; Many of the 
		most beautiful gold specimens are the ones that have the lacy gold 
		extruding from the pure white milky quartz.&quot; <br>

		<p><font size="2">Here is a close up photo of some of the tailings which 
		contain milky white quartz.&nbsp; Maybe you can find some gold out in 
		the East Potrillo Mountains?&nbsp; Let us know and we will show you 
		where this test mine is....</font><br>

		<p><font size="2">Off-the-grid-country near an alternate launch site for 
		hang gliders and paragliders north of BC South Launch.&nbsp; Why do we 
		go out here?&nbsp; Dark sky, no city sprawl, quiet as anything and 
		beautiful views.&nbsp; This a view looking east with the Organ Mountains 
		over 44 miles in the distance.<br>

		<p><font size="2">You never know what you may find out in the middle of 
		nowhere.&nbsp; Below are two folks, Art and Sue, with their pack animals 
		traveling the lonely road from Deming, New Mexico to El Paso, Texas.&nbsp; 
		They are about 7 miles northwest of Santa Teresa, New Mexico on County 
		Rd A17.&nbsp; I drove by them on the way back from Kilbourne Hole.&nbsp; 
		I went about 100 yards and then stopped, &quot;What were two riders and two 
		pack horses doing out here?&quot;&nbsp; They were not ranchers as ranchers 
		never ride a horse in these parts as the distances are too great and dry 
		for working horses.&nbsp; The more I thought about it, the more I 
		realized I needed to check with them (and get this photo).</font></p>
		<p><font size="2">Art and Sue are traveling across the United States by 
		horseback and have gone almost 2,000 miles in the last 3 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		They started in Broken Bow, Nebraska.&nbsp; Everything they own in the 
		world is what you see here.&nbsp; They support themselves by finding odd 
		jobs here and there as they travel.&nbsp; Art packs a full size Ruger 
		.45 revolver and a shotgun with 3&quot; magnum deer slugs  –  which means he 
		is pretty much ready for anything, especially hungry bears or mountain 
		lions.&nbsp; Thanks to less than intelligent legislatures, lions are 
		hunted less which makes them more aggressive and less afraid of humans 
		 –  not so good if you find yourself alone in the boondocks.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2">To make a long story short, my neighbor (and 
		experienced horsewoman), Dawn Oakley, and I took these folks in for a 
		couple of days.&nbsp; Dawn boarded the horses and Marilyn and I boarded 
		the humans.&nbsp; They had not slept in a bed for over a month and 
		needed time to wash, clean, repair, and re-provision for their journey 
		east  –  to Dallas.&nbsp; They will take State Highway 180 which is a 
		paved road but even more remote than the dirt road from the Deming to El 
		Paso.&nbsp; It is about 95 miles from El Paso to Guadalupe Mountains 
		National Park and the highest peak in Texas  –  over 8,500'.&nbsp; I 
		admire how tough, honest, and transparent these folks are  –  a breath of 
		fresh air in the world we live in.&nbsp; Why did we take them in?&nbsp; 
		If you have ever traveled for days or weeks in foreign territory in 
		tough circumstances, you would understand  –  especially if someone 
		showed you some grace.</font><br>
