		Lee Boone, Had Robinson (pilots) and Marilyn &amp; Tirzah Robinson (drivers) 
		headed off to launch late Saturday and arrived about 5 PM.&nbsp; Winds 
		were strong (gusting to 25 mph) at launch so Lee &amp; Had hiked around the 
		ridge.&nbsp; We decided to wait about an hour and a half to be sure that 
		things had calmed down as we had to be certain that there was no chance 
		of getting blown over the back of the ridge after launch.&nbsp; For a 
		two minute video of the highlights, go
		<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhdduYl_13g">here</a>.</p>
		<p>We launched just before 8PM and went quickly up in the 12-15 mph air 
		that was coming straight in.&nbsp; Both pilots had an easy time getting 
		500' over launch in the laminar air.&nbsp; If we had crystal balls, we 
		would have launched earlier but, generally, pilots must be absolutely 
		certain of conditions at world-class sites such as Dry Canyon.&nbsp; 
		Cascading events can get pilots in big trouble so they must do 
		everything possible to minimize risk which means, <i>&quot;If you don't feel 
		100%, don't fly.&quot;</i></p>
		<p>This view is of the Dry Canyon ridge.&nbsp; Launch is just to the 
		lower right of the photo.&nbsp; The towering ridge of the Sacramento's 
		(9,500') is visible in the background.&nbsp; The desert presents a 
		beautiful sunset glow off of the formerly active systems that had 
		developed during the day.</p>

		</p>
		<p>We could not spend much time soaring the ridge because it would mean 
		landing in the dark.&nbsp; We headed out to the LZ but only at 7-8 mph 
		over the ground because of the high winds aloft.&nbsp; To ensure that we 
		got to the LZ as quickly as possible, we applied speed bar which 
		increased our over the ground speed to over 12 mph.</p>
		<p>Flying in the desert sunset is magic!&nbsp; The San Andres mountain 
		range of New Mexico is just visible at the bottom of the photo.&nbsp; 
		(The pilot below is Lee Boone - this is his first time to land at the 
		main LZ for Dry Canyon.)</p>
		<p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="DSC01958%20doc.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>We are just about out of light - it's time to land!&nbsp; The only 
		turbulence encountered was by Had as he flew behind and below Lee and 
		encountered the vortices that spin off the wing tips of a glider.&nbsp; 
		This swirling air moves out and down.&nbsp; The air over Alamogordo was 
		moving up everywhere in the &quot;glass off&quot; which made our trip from launch 
		even longer.&nbsp; We landed at the main LZ in dead air which meant a 
		significant run.&nbsp; It was another magic flight at Dry!</p>
