		<b><font size="5">Dry Canyon - rock work &amp; flights - Saturday, March 6, 
		2010</font></b><p>RGSA President Robin Hastings (HG) led a pack of 
		pilots up the hill to launch.&nbsp; They included:&nbsp; Lee Boone (PG), 
		Mike Ellsworth (HG), visiting pilot Jason Cade, Had Robinson (PG), and 
		driver Bahrat Kumar - a PhD student and friend of Robin's.&nbsp; We are expecting 
		some photos of Jason and Lee soon - we will update this page.</p>
		<p>Conditions were weak - weaker than most had ever seen at this site.&nbsp; 
		At times, winds at launch were calm.&nbsp; Rather than bemoan the poor 
		conditions to fly, we all spent an hour or two gathering huge rocks for 
		the upcoming fix-up day where we will do some major repairs on the Dry 
		Canyon launch pad used primarily for HG pilots.</p>
		<p>Conditions became better around 2PM with a 6-8 mph breeze from the 
		SW.&nbsp; Lee Boone and Jason Cade launched and got right above launch 
		but were unable to stay in the lift band as conditions weakened again.&nbsp; 
		It's about a ten minute cycle and pilots must be exceedingly careful 
		during the lulls not to sink out -- staying up at those times is part of 
		the learning curve in mastering Dry Canyon.</p>
		<p><b>Aborted Launch</b>&nbsp; Had Robinson prepared to launch after Lee 
		and Jason but had to abort.&nbsp; 
		<a href="../../../../TrainingInfo/heshe.htm">He</a> noticed that his reserve handle was 
		hanging loose during the routine pre-flight check.&nbsp; Another pilot 
		was being helpful and accidently grabbed the handle and yanked it, 
		releasing the pins which hold the reserve in place in the harness.&nbsp; 
		Flying with the reserve loose can result in an accidental deployment - 
		it's about 50-50 that it will come out, especially during turbulence in 
		flight or setting up for landing.&nbsp; Had had to stop the launch 
		process and reset the reserve in its container on the harness.&nbsp; He 
		then launched without incident and flew at the face near launch until it 
		started raining, his first time to ever experience it in the air.&nbsp; 
		Rain is not good for PG as too much can be absorbed by the wing and 
		drastically change its flying characteristics.&nbsp; Rather than guess 
		if it would end soon (which it did), he jammed the speed bar to &quot;full&quot; 
		and made a bee-line to the LZ, landing safely after a 40 minute flight.&nbsp; 
		If it starts to rain hard, pilots must make an emergency landing 
		immediately.</p>
		<p>We welcome pilot PG Jason Cade who recently moved from Salt Lake City 
		to undertake engineering studies at UT El Paso.</p>
		<p>Here are some photos of our day yesterday - more will be posted as 
		they come in.&nbsp; We had quite a crowd of visitors at launch Saturday 
		afternoon including a carload of youth, two off-roader's, and two ATV's.&nbsp; 
		Robin and his glider can just be seen at launch.</p>

		<p>Launch from directly above - Robin Hastings is preparing to launch.&nbsp; 
		The man in front of Robin's glider with the blue jacket is Mike 
		Ellsworth, a hang glider pilot assisting Robin.&nbsp; The cycles were 
		weak but, because of an approaching storm, they began to grow in 
		strength.&nbsp; Robin is waiting for just the right moment.</p>

		<p>Robin, our weather expert, knew that conditions for hang gliding were 
		too weak so he makes for the LZ.&nbsp; Robin has never had any serious 
		mishaps after decades of hang gliding.&nbsp; Why is this?&nbsp; It is 
		not luck but is his determination to minimize or eliminate risk.&nbsp; 
		Launching and flying in bad conditions (above our skill level), doing 
		maneuvers near the ground, and not being ready to land at any time 
		probably eliminates 90% of our risk.&nbsp; Robin is an expert in these 
		three aspects and many more....</p>

		<p>We had about 15 visitors at launch who watched the soaring pilots at 
		Dry Canyon.</p>
