				<p><b>February 29 Wednesday - Kilbourne Hole Maar Epic </b>- Air 
				coming in was about 220 degrees at 15-18 mph, sometimes surging 
				even higher.&nbsp; Pilots Lee Boone &amp; Had Robinson needed to 
				fly! The winds were on the edge.&nbsp; The Jet was overhead but 
				we figured that this volcanic monster was low enough that Jet 
				turbulence would be minimal.&nbsp; The beauty of flying in a 
				crater is that you start out near ground level and fly over a 
				giant hole in the ground 2 miles across.&nbsp; Lee was the first 
				to go up from the west facing main launch.&nbsp; He was able to 
				soar the SSW facing part of the launch area  –  and go high, 
				higher than he ever had before.&nbsp; Had launched next about 
				1/4 north of the main launch but the flight was short because 
				the winds were turning more south.&nbsp; He launched again from 
				the main launch and went up  –  and up and up  –  higher than he 
				had ever been at this site, reaching an AGL of over 600'.&nbsp; 
				At this height he flew up wind to get out of the lift.&nbsp; Who 
				knows how much higher it went?&nbsp; Both pilots had some tip 
				folds and other anomalies for air so late in the day so we 
				decided it was best to come down.&nbsp; Flying when the Jet is 
				overhead is always dicey.&nbsp; We probably should not have been 
				in the air this day  –  but the flight at Kilbourne was EPIC.</p>

		<p><font size="2">Had at 600' AGL!&nbsp; The dark rock is the layer of 
		volcanic basalt that was thrown up when the crater exploded (this is one 
		of few flyable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilbourne_Hole">
		maars</a> in the world).&nbsp;&nbsp; He is twice the height of the 
		rim to the bottom of the crater.&nbsp; How so high?&nbsp; He is not 
		flying backwards so it must be some sort of wave lift added to the ridge 
		at the rim.&nbsp; This was a record for Kilbourne Hole Maar.&nbsp; In the 
		distance to the right are the East Potrillo Mountains.<br>

		<p><font size="2">More parking above Kilbourne Hole Maar.&nbsp; The air was

		<p><font size="2">Lee top landed just SE of launch.&nbsp; If you land at 
		the bottom of the Hole, it's a 40 minute hike back out.&nbsp; In the far 
		distance are the Franklin Mountains.<br>
