			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif"><b>November 6 
			Tuesday  –  The Chihuahuan Desert</b>  – &nbsp; There is one word that 
			describes this desert located in the
			<a href="http://geography.about.com/od/physicalgeography/a/tradewinds.htm">
			Horse latitudes</a> of the northern hemisphere: <b>VAST</b>.&nbsp; 
			Flying over the region is like flying over the ocean.&nbsp; The 
			pilot here took a trip west from the Gardiner sod farms to the west 
			side of the East Potrillo Mountains, north to Kilbourne Hole, and 
			then southeast back to the sod farms  –  a 50 mile trip.</span></p>
				<p>Heading west  –  the East and West Potrillo Mountains are 
				visible in the far distance.&nbsp; Mt. Riley is the peak in the 
				middle.</p>
				<p>

				<p>Flying <a href="../../../../FAQs/FAQs.htm">PPG</a> has its 
				advantages over <a href="../../../../FAQs/FAQs.htm">PG</a> in 
				that the pilot can fly for long periods very close to the ground 
				 –  even touching the tips of the cactus with his feet.&nbsp; 
				Here is one of the occasional oases in this desert.&nbsp; 
				The water for the cattle (and other critters) in this particular 
				tank is trucked in from many miles away.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_1104.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
				<p>Another view of the Chihuahuan Desert, the largest in the 
				western hemisphere, looking south deep into Mexico.&nbsp; This 
				is dark sky country where only satellite phones and Amateur 
				Radio work.&nbsp; Even the occasional communications tower must 
				be powered solar cells  –  there are no utilities and water is 
				about 600' below the surface.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_1109.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
				<p>This is the west face of the East Potrillo Mountains (Mt. Cox 
				and the West Potrillo Mountains are in the distance).&nbsp; The 
				view here is northwest.&nbsp; I was able to ridge soar the ridge 
				to the right in the photo below.&nbsp; Winds were south at 6 and 
				hit the range at an angle but it was still soarable  –  barely.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_1110.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
				<p>Another advantage of PPG is that a pilot can safely go over 
				the back of mountains from the windward side.&nbsp; In PG, this 
				can be a terrifying experience because a pilot cannot be sure 
				that he can fly high enough to avoid the rotor behind the ridge.&nbsp; 
				In the photo below I am downwind of the range.&nbsp; I climbed 
				out on the windward site and then darted downwind over the top 
				of the range.&nbsp; Just like at a dam in a river, the air at 
				the top edge of the range was moving <i>fast</i>  –  over 30 mph.&nbsp; 
				It was fun getting whisked over the top and then catapulted 
				downwind.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_1116.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
				<p>This is another &quot;hueco&quot; or tank.&nbsp; It was made in a 
				natural low spot by some rancher decades ago and then carefully 
				lined with clay so that it would not leak.&nbsp; The water in it 
				is from past rainfall and can remain for many months  –  until 
				the next rain.&nbsp; These tanks rarely run dry and provide 
				water for all thirsty creatures in the desert.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_1117.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
				<p>Hunt's Hole is a few miles south of
				<a href="../../../../SiteInfo/KilbourneHoleMaar/kilbourne.htm">
				Kilbourne Hole</a> which is visible in the distance.&nbsp; Both 
				maars never fill with water because of the huge lava dooms that 
				are deep beneath them in the earth.&nbsp; If a hiker visits the 
				bottom of these maars he will see small drain holes (6&quot; in 
				diameter or so) and huge cracks where the water and mud go after 
				a rain.&nbsp; I have seen drain holes at the bottom of Hunt's 
				that are almost big enough to crawl down....&nbsp; One can only 
				imagine the size of the dome below that never fills up.&nbsp; 
				The view here is north.&nbsp; The maar is about 1 mile in 
				diameter.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_1119.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
				<p>Kilbourne Hole  –  the east ridge of the maar is almost 400' 
				above the bottom of the maar which makes it a fine ridge soaring 
				site when winds are westerly  –  one of the safest in the region.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="../../../../SiteInfo/KilbourneHoleMaar/kilbourne.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
				<p>This is the view mile after mile after mile back to the sod 
				farms. (The Franklin Mountains are in the distance.)&nbsp; Going 
				along 20' over the ground is great sport.&nbsp; Desert travelers 
				that leave tracks can be comforted to know that the wind storms 
				we have every few months will obliterate the evidence 
				completely.&nbsp; The mounds are formed by the blowing sand 
				getting caught by the mesquite trees and can be up to 15' high.&nbsp; 
				If it were not for these tough trees (and enough rainfall to 
				keep them alive), the landscape would be quite different, more 
				like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algodones_Dunes">here</a>.</p>
