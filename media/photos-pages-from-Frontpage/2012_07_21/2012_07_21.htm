				<p><b>July 21 Saturday  –  Trip down the Rio Grande through El Paso, 
				Texas/Juarez, Mexico</b></p>
		<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; color: #282A55">
		Adventurers Glenn Tupper and Had Robinson wanted to set another first 
		for powered ultralights in the world:&nbsp; A trip down the Rio Grande right 
		on the border of the two cities of El Paso, TX USA and Cd. Juarez, Chih. 
		Mexico.&nbsp;An outstanding YouTube video of the trip highlights created by 
		Glenn can be seen
		<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Col4Qa-jII">
		here</a>. To see more of Glenn's outstanding aerial photography and 
		videos, go
		<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.paratupper.com/">
		here</a>.&nbsp; Launching from the Gardiner Turf farms in Santa Teresa, NM we 
		headed southeast across the desert.&nbsp; (Note: U.S. border and air 
		authorities were properly notified and gave us a &quot;heads up&quot; for the 
		flight.)</span></p>
		<p>The busy Stanton Street bridge over the concrete gully know as the 
		Rio Grande river.&nbsp; Thousands of Mexican pedestrians are waiting in 
		line to apply for immigration status largely to avoid the violence in 
		the world's most violent city.&nbsp; We did not have any bullet holes in 
		our wings (we would shoot back, anyway).<br>

		<p>Glenn heading southeast from the towards the border.&nbsp; One of the 
		largest solar cell farms in the nation is in the background.&nbsp; It is 
		located in Santa Teresa, NM.&nbsp; Glenn is flying the Paramania Fusion 
		powered with Parajet Polini 200.<br>

		<p>Our view of the Rio Grande (before it goes into irrigation ditches 
		and disappears).&nbsp; This view is southeast.<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_0455.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>Passing by Mt. Cristo Rey where a huge Crucifix stands at the very 
		top of the mountain.&nbsp; View is south and much of Juarez is in the 
		background.<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_0457.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>The ASARCO smokestack  –  when it was built it was the tallest 
		structure in the world.&nbsp; Engineers designed it so that effluent 
		would be emitted in the air above the still air of the deep inversion 
		that forms in the region every night (it is about 1,000' thick).&nbsp; 
		In this way, the smoke would enter the moving air above the inversion 
		instead of filling the city with smoke every night.&nbsp; Of course, 
		residents would not be protected from the massive amounts of lead dust 
		which would still waft their way down  –  even through the inversion,&nbsp; 
		We would have flown closer but we hate making the 6 o'clock news for any 
		reason....<br>

		<p>Downtown El Paso with Interstate Hwy 10 running right along the 
		border.<br>

		<p>Another photo of the jammed Stanton Street bridge.&nbsp; Juarez is 
		one of the top examples in the world of this cliché, &quot;<i>When guns are 
		outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.</i>&quot;&nbsp; Ordinary Mexican 
		citizens armed with 12 gauge shotguns would have likely ended this 
		pandemonium a decade ago.&nbsp; El Paso, on the other hand, is the 
		safest city of its size in the U.S.&nbsp; If your town was being shot up 
		by the battle between violent thugs and government troops, what would 
		you do?<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_0469.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>A one of a kind photo of downtown El Paso from its southern border.&nbsp; 
		The ASARCO stack is visible in the distance.<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_0471.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>The mighty Rio Grande river (the dry gulch between the bushes).&nbsp; 
		All the water in the river runs through a canal east of here to farms in 
		the Rio Grande valley southeast of the city.&nbsp; This region has 
		become extremely dry in recent years.<br>

		<p>I, the wingman, flying along with Glenn Tupper as we cruise up the 
		border to the northwest on our return trip.&nbsp; The Mexican police (or 
		whoever poses as them) followed us along to the left for a while.&nbsp; 
		We often trade wingman positions as we had no idea what the Mexican 
		authorities would do.&nbsp; If we had a problem (being shot at), we 
		would immediately land on the U.S. side of the river and take refuge 
		with the U.S. Border Patrol who are everywhere.<br>

		<p>I hope you enjoyed the show!&nbsp; How can a guy not smile after 
		having so much fun and a safe landing?&nbsp; Glenn Tupper is one of the 
		top PPG adventurers on planet earth and I hope you will visit his
		<a href="http://www.paratupper.com/">website</a>.&nbsp; We see the world 
		from a perspective not shared by any other aircraft.&nbsp; Our problem?&nbsp; 
		Glenn and I egg each other on....&nbsp;<span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;
