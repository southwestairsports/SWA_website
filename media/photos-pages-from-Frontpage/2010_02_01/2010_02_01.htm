		<p><b>Monday - February 1,2010 Agave Hill - Flights full of 
		surprises!</b></p>
					<p>Pilots:&nbsp; Had Robinson &amp; Lee Boone</p>
		<p>All of the models and forecasts said that the Franklins would have 
		good (but not crazy) winds aloft so Lee and Had set out to launch.&nbsp; As is daily the case, 
		the inversion in the valley region was about 1,200' thick (top = 5,200') 
		and launch is right at 5,200'.&nbsp; Would we be able to get above it 
		and into the steady westerly winds that glide over the valley inversion?</p>
		<p>Agave Hill is the one of the most technical launch sites in the 
		region.&nbsp; This is because a pilot has to time his launch carefully,&nbsp; 
		aim for the place with lift, and get up quickly.&nbsp; Otherwise, he will never 
		get high enough to get over Deep Sink Canyon and bench the Franklins.&nbsp; Lee launched first, went 
		too far in front, got out of any lift, and sank out and had to land.&nbsp; 
		He re-packed his glider and hiked to launch again.</p>
		<p><font size="2">Below: Had is about 2/3's the way to the south end of the 
		Franklins.&nbsp; View is SE.&nbsp; Altitude is about 7,000' here.</font><br>
		<img border="0" src="DSC02769.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>Had launched, stayed close to the hill, and flew north.&nbsp; Just at 
		the end of hill is our &quot;house ridge lift&quot; and he quickly got the 200' 
		minimum over launch that is required to go south and be high enough 
		where the big lift is: <b>The Triangle</b>.&nbsp; Lee followed and, this time, 
		got in the &quot;house ridge lift&quot;, jumped to the Triangle where both pilots 
		steadily worked their way up and over the top.&nbsp; Lee went higher -- 
		much higher than our tallest peak in the smooth lift and parked at the 
		top of it!</p>
		<p><font size="2">Below: A view north of the Franklins from near South 
		Mt. Franklin.&nbsp; Had is still 1,000' higher than the range after 
		gliding out of the super lift in front of N. Mt. Franklin.&nbsp; What is 
		Secret Hill?&nbsp; If you are crossing the Dragon's Mouth (Transmountain 
		Gap) from the south, you must be above and in front of Secret Hill.&nbsp; 
		If you are south of it or lower, you will have to apply full speed bar 
		to escape the vortex of the Gap and land somewhere west of the Gap.&nbsp; 
		Just at Secret Hill the lift begins again and a pilot can then follow 
		the ridge and climb right back up and beyond!</font><br>
		<img border="0" src="DSC02770.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>However, Had did not stop 
		but went south to the end of the Franklins, just over 9 
		miles from launch.&nbsp; His farthest point south was the end of E. 
		Robinson Dr. - the road which goes up to the radio towers.&nbsp; No 
		paraglider has ever ventured that far south in the Franklins.&nbsp; He 
		also probably set a record for getting the highest in ridge lift over the 
		Franklins - over 1,500' above the top of N. Mt. Franklin.&nbsp; Both 
		pilots landed safely at Tom Mays Park -- just at dusk!</p>
		<p><font size="2">Below: View of S. Mt. Franklin (Radio Peak) to the 
		east and below the summit. Had's began his return trip from the south 
		end the Franklins with 3,000' less altitude as the more south you go, 
		the lower the mountains get.&nbsp; As today had zero thermals, a pilot 
		must follow the ridge lift.</font><br>
		<img border="0" src="DSC02790.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p><font size="2">Below:&nbsp; Heading towards &quot;The Elephant&quot; is the way 
		to get back up over the top of the mountains.&nbsp; Out in front (to the 
		west) of The Elephant is LIFT.&nbsp; Had was able to climb back up to 
		over 7,000' in order cross the Dragon's Mouth north of here.</font><br>
		<img border="0" src="DSC02792.JPG" width="1024" height="768"><p>
		It was a great day to fly the Franklins in pure ridge lift which enables 
		us to find the areas of best lift (and worst sink) for future flights.<p>
		Below is a track of the flight - about 20 miles.<p>
