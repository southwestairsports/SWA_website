		<font size="4">June 8th - 9th, 2012 The Little Bear Fire - near Ruidoso, 
		NM</font><p>Ski Apache has turned on the snow machines to protect the 
		buildings!</p>
		<p>These are pictures taken by Had Robinson of the Little Bear 
		fire near Ruidoso, NM.</p>
		<p>Friday afternoon at Ski Apache looking northwest.&nbsp; We had camped 
		there for the purpose of doing some site work at Ski Apache.&nbsp; It 
		didn't seem like much was going on and neither the great folks at Ski 
		Apache nor the authorities had asked anyone to evacuate.</p>
		<p>

		<p>Below  –  about 30 minutes later than the photo above.&nbsp; The 
		effects of the strong winds can be seen.&nbsp; Still no word from 
		the authorities - so we left our RV, equipment, and dog Max in the 
		parking lot at Ski Apache and went down 
		the mountain for dinner with friends.</p>
		<p>

		<p>Saturday, June 9th.&nbsp; We were unable to go back up Ski Run Road 
		(Hwy 532) 
		to fetch our dog and equipment so we spent the night with friends in Ruidoso.&nbsp; 
		It was not a good night for us as we had visions of our equipment 
		destroyed and our dog being burned alive.&nbsp; The next morning we got up at dawn and got 
		permission to go back up to Ski Apache and fetch everything.&nbsp; We 
		are extremely grateful to the Fire Command for letting us return to our 
		site.&nbsp; 
		The photo below was at 6:30AM about 3 miles down from the top of Ski Run Rd 
		(Hwy 532) at its most northerly point.&nbsp; The fire 
		was increasing in intensity in the North Eagle Creek canyon.</p>
		<p>

		<p>Below  –  Ski Apache early Saturday morning, June 9th.&nbsp; Personnel were 
		preparing to spray the buildings with water.&nbsp; We were able to hook 
		up our RV, get Max, gather up all of our equipment (especially our 
		stored gasoline), and leave.</p>
		<p>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_0190.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>Below  –  Ski Run Road a few hundred yards from the top.&nbsp; 
		We knew it was time to beat it.&nbsp; Thankfully, the ski area is in the 
		lee of the strong winds from the southwest so they were not anywhere near as strong as 
		west of here and higher.&nbsp; If winds had been from the west, this 
		area would have been an inferno like what later happened in the Monjeau 
		Peak area.</p>
		<p>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_0191.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>Below  –  The dead tree above the mirror was set on fire by the 
		&quot;fingers&quot; of fire creeping along the ground here and there.&nbsp; If 
		there had been any serious winds, it would have been all over for us and 
		we would have lost everything.</p>
		<p>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_0192.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>Below  –  The fire spreading closer to the road.&nbsp; I was 
		frightened by the prospect of a burning tree falling across the road and 
		blocking our escape.&nbsp; Thankfully, I had the equipment to quickly 
		move heavy timber in case something like that might have happened.&nbsp; 
		You do what you have to do.</p>
		<p>The winds were not in danger of changing direction. If they had been, 
		we would not have attempted to rescue our equipment and dog.&nbsp; We 
		ought to know about weather.&nbsp; It has been my business for many 
		years to carefully study the weather because our safety as ultralight 
		pilots depends on it.&nbsp; We knew (as well as everybody else in the 
		whole world who cares about such things) that Friday and Saturday were 
		going to be blow-outs.&nbsp; The fire would go in the direction of the 
		winds  –  which it did (and always does).</p>

		<p>Below  –  Looking northeast from Ski Run Road just below its most 
		northerly portion  –  North Eagle Creek and environs.</p>
		<p>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_0196.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>Below  –  The deserted Hwy 48 - the fire crossed the road north of here and 
		only emergency traffic was permitted.&nbsp; We are headed south and away 
		from the fire.</p>

		<p>We hope that the firefighters are able to end this devastation as
