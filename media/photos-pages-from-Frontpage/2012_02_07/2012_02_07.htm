				<p><b>February 7 Tuesday  –  E. Potrillo Mountains</b>  –  <i>a 
				record setting flight!</i>&nbsp; Early in the day, it looked 
				like we would be blown out.&nbsp; The forecast had gusting with 
				very high winds.&nbsp; But this is why we watch the real-time 
				air at the Santa Teresa Airport:&nbsp; Things started to calm 
				down in the early afternoon.&nbsp; Everything was lining up for 
				strong air (+15) right out of the east which is perfect for the 
				E. Potrillo Mountains.&nbsp; But what about the gusting?&nbsp; 
				The forecast was base wind + 5 which is not excessive for 
				paragliding.</p>
		<p>So I (Had) threw the switch at around 3PM.&nbsp; Time to move it - grab 
		all of the gear and jump in the truck as there would not be a whole lot 
		of time to drive the 30+ miles.&nbsp; I still had to do the trek up to 
		the
		<a href="../../../../SiteInfo/EastPotrilloMtns/e_potrillo_mtns.htm#TORREY_PASO_EAST_LAUNCH">
		Torrey Paso</a> launch that is just below a ridge in the range.&nbsp; 
		When you are alone, your launch has to be perfect.&nbsp; In high winds, 
		that means setting up the glider on the ground in such a way (a tight 
		but inflatable rosette) that it will not get inflated by the air until 
		the pilot is ready.&nbsp; When it's time to go, the glider must be 
		brought up perfectly square as the pilot cannot launch crosswise into 
		the wind as that would take him right over the back.&nbsp; Before the 
		glider even gets overhead, you are in the air and must be ready to touch 
		the speed bar as going over the back of the ridge could be an adventure.</p>
		<p>Everything went well and I got up and off!&nbsp; It was a grand 
		flight, the highest and longest yet in the East Potrillo Mountains.</p>
		<p><font size="2">Over the top of the range looking northwest.&nbsp; Mt. 
		Riley (R) and Mt. Cox (L) are in the distance.<br>

		<p><font size="2">Looking over the highest peak in the East Potrillo 
		Mountains.&nbsp; The lift band today was the strongest a pilot could 
		safely fly in.&nbsp; We should never fly in air where we need speed bar 
		to penetrate forward in the air.&nbsp; The air at altitude was  
		20+ mph.&nbsp; In the very far distance are the volcanic cones of the 
		West Potrillo Mountains.<br>

		<p><font size="2">Near the north end of the range.&nbsp; I got to the 
		the little peak in the lower right but dared not go any further as  
		it would be too easy to get out of the lift band and have to land 
		somewhere many miles from launch.&nbsp; Saddles and the ends of ranges are vortices where the 
		air quickly speeds up and it is very easy to get sucked into them.&nbsp; 
		Pushing your fortunes here would mean 6-7 mile hike through the 
		desert...<br>

		<p><font size="2">Over the top of the range looking south.&nbsp; It was 
		getting late in the day and, in such strong conditions, it is not wise 
		to land in the dark.&nbsp; The Torrey Paso LZ is that white area at the 
		base of the range to the left.&nbsp; Note how far out in front the lift 
		band is.&nbsp; I am over a mile in front of the range.&nbsp; I landed halfway from the LZ to launch.<br>
