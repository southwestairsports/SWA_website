		<b>Lee's Lookout - Franklin Mountains State Park - 
		March 3, 2010 </b>(formerly &quot;Deadman's&quot;)</font><p>Lee Boone (first time) &amp; Had 
		Robinson (second time) successfully launched from the new Franklin 
		Mountains State Park Deadman's launch site.&nbsp; There is no question 
		this can become the launch of choice in the Franklin Mountains (<b><i>subject 
		to Park approval</i></b>) as it is safer because of its altitude and 
		much greater slope.&nbsp; It is an easy 12 minute hike from the 
		Transmountain Pass highway.&nbsp; Both PG and HG can bail easily, if 
		necessary, to long stretches of cleared dirt road that is well within an 
		easy glide.&nbsp; There are plenty of thermal triggers and sources out 
		in front -- much more than Agave Hill.&nbsp; As the site is in winds 
		aloft, launching and getting up when conditions are weak is possible as 
		demonstrated this day.</p>
		<p>Lee Boone was the incentive behind us looking for new 
		and better launches in the Franklins and, thanks to him, we decided to 
		try this new site.&nbsp; THANK YOU, LEE FOR HELPING US DEVELOP NEW SITES 
		IN THE REGION.&nbsp; Our advice:&nbsp; Always turn south (left) or 
		go straight out from launch.</p>
		<p>Lee Boone surveying the view from Lee's Lookout.&nbsp; Note the steep 
		slope which will allow easy launch for both HG and PG. View here is to 
		the northwest.<br>

		<p>&quot;View through the risers&quot; - Having thermalled up from Lee's 
		Lookout, Had 
		took this photo facing south.&nbsp; McKelligon Canyon is easily visible 
		in the center of the photo.<br>

		<p>A rare shot looking down on South Mt Franklin (Radio Peak) with east 
		El Paso and El Paso International Airport in the background.&nbsp; How 
		can pilots not keep smiling in such a place as this - challenge, ridge 
		lift, abundant thermals, friendly authorities, and a public that loves 
		all kinds of adventure?<br>

		<p>Flight path from Lee Boone's GPS.&nbsp; He flew extremely well for 
		being new to the sport (&lt; 1 year).&nbsp; Lee had the longest distance 
		between launch and landing in the Franklins to date. <br>

		<p>Lee Boone in his Niviuk Koyot flying at over 7,500'.&nbsp; View is 
		looking south.&nbsp; Cristo Rey is just visible at 7:30 from the pilot.&nbsp; 
		Lee is gaining the skills in this incomparable region so he can fly 
		anywhere in the world.&nbsp; The Franklins act as &quot;thermal mergers&quot; in 
		this particular part of the range.&nbsp; Smaller thermals are set loose 
		at lower altitudes and then, because of the unique canyons and ridges of 
		the Franklins, they can merge, becoming giants that are wider and less 
		turbulent.&nbsp; This is no more evident than the southwest corner of 
		North Mt. Franklin where the lift is huge and never ending.&nbsp; We 
		have not topped out the lift there.&nbsp; Can someone help us?<br>

		<p>Lee cruising at 7,000' near launch.&nbsp; It took him a half hour to 
		work the lift and thermals to get up so high.&nbsp; We are both floating 
		on top of the world!&nbsp; Late in the day, conditions are mellow and 
		the less experienced are not going to get tossed around.<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC02898.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>Had took this photo of N. Mount Franklin while cruising back and 
		fourth west of the peak where &quot;the lift never ends&quot;.&nbsp; He was going 
		to top land but the lift was too strong to safely approach the peak.&nbsp; 
		Today, we had an inversion at 9,000' and got with 500' of it.&nbsp; 
		While all other types of non-soaring aircraft don't know or care about 
		inversions (where the air gets warmer rather than cooler as you go up), 
		it is important to us as thermals and ridge lift END at inversions.&nbsp; 
		At this point, they gets very turbulent.&nbsp; Imagine squirting a water 
		hose at a brick wall - everything goes well until the water hits the 
		brick and then it goes everywhere.&nbsp; It's exactly the same when 
		moving air hits an inversion layer.<br>

		<p>Had is way above the Franklin Range (over 8,000') when he took this 
		photo from out in front of the SW corner of N. Mt. Franklin.&nbsp; As 
		mentioned earlier, right here is the central focus of thermal 
		convergence which gives broad and smooth lift up to the limits of the 
		air (where the next inversion is located).&nbsp; As we check the balloon 
		soundings nearly every day, we will pick a day with no inversion and see 
		how high we can get.&nbsp; Stay tuned!<br>

		<p>Had took this photo just after he landed on the Tom Mays Park main 
		road.&nbsp; The white car is the Sheriff's who patiently waited while 
		Had got his gear out of the way.&nbsp; It took a half hour to come down 
		from over 8,000'.<br>
