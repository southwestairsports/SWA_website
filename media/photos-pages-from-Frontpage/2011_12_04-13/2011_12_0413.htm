				<p><b>December 12 Valle de Bravo, Mexico</b>  –  There are few 
				places in the world where a pilot can develop his thermalling 
				skills as here – beginning to advanced. One of the most 
				difficult skills is safely flying in a gaggle of 30 pilots or 
				more. While it is easier to thermal (others will act as guides 
				to the lift), the primary concern is watching out for other 
				pilots. Often gaggles contain inexperienced or careless pilots 
				who are a grave danger to everyone. Aggressive and rude pilots 
				are also annoying. But this is almost always true only at 
				launch. Once you get cross country, the numbers drop 75% and you 
				usually fly only with those who are experienced. And here is the 
				treat: Thermalling with 2-4 other pilots is outstanding because 
				the small gaggle can really zero on the core of the thermal. So, 
				when conditions weaken (as they always do), the gaggle has a 
				greater chance of staying aloft than the single pilot.&nbsp; I 
				once flew in a gaggle with two German pilots out in the flats  –  
				we would have all sunk out if we had not focused on each other 
				every moment.&nbsp; As it was, we carefully climbed to altitude 
				in a very weak thermal –  and went far, far away.&nbsp; It was 
				hard work as it takes 100% of every bit of mental skill one has.</p>
				<p>The land where our LZ is has had corn fields (visible below) 
				for a hundred generations  –  and is farmed by the same people 
				today.&nbsp; The soil is amazingly fertile and deep so that the 
				farmer does not need to add fertilizer other than maybe cow 
				manure now and then.</p>
				<p>

				<br>
				The terrain here is so varied and requires great skill to stay 
				up once you leave the general launch area -– as I am finding 
				out. One big thing I learned is that when you start out XC and 
				find a bit too much sink where you are headed, turn back and get 
				back in the lift where you were. Be patient! One of the top 
				pilots here, Damian Mitchell (SLC), made three starts out of 
				lift to go cross country  –  and succeeded.&nbsp; He also gave us 
				tips for flying inside clouds safely.&nbsp; Be sure to mount 
				your compass on your shirt away from your instruments (GPS, in 
				particular) as they mess up your compass.&nbsp; Like all pilots, 
				when you go in the clouds, you tend to fly in circles which can 
				be unnerving.&nbsp; Keep your eyeballs on your compass AND GPS 
				 –  don't waste your time looking ahead.&nbsp; You will not see 
				anything, anyway.<br>
				<br>
				Our expert hang glider pilots would have a challenge here – 
				thermals were narrow and strong and thus hard to stay in. I 
				think that Robin, Bill, or Riker could have really gone on a 
				long trip. As it was, not one of the HG guys made it out of the 
				general launch area.</p>
				<p>I hope you can join me next time at Valle de Bravo  –  one of 
				the world's great thermalling sites!</p>

				who were waiting for me.)<br>

				<b>December 5-7 Valle de Bravo, Mexico</b>  –  There are about 
				50 pilots from all over the world here at this world class 
				paragliding and hang gliding site.&nbsp; The reason it is so 
				popular is that for about 6 months, we can fly everyday.&nbsp; 
				The area is so popular because it has a wide range of skill 
				levels.&nbsp; Inexperienced pilots can do their first 
				thermalling right off the main launch and safely land at a huge 
				LZ a mile away.&nbsp; Advanced pilots can leave the launch area 
				and do cross-country winding their way through a complex 
				mountain range with numerous dead zones, hot spots, and 
				fascinating geography.&nbsp; There is no ridge soaring here  –  
				it is strictly a thermalling site.&nbsp; The challenge is to get 
				high enough over launch to leave and go over the back (east) or 
				cross a huge bowl that is all sinky air to reach El Pe<font face="Verdana">ñon 
				to the north  –  that huge point of rock.</font></p>

				Earth image of my (Had's) flight December 7th.&nbsp; Starting at 
				the red tack, you can see how we thermal up and cross from one 
				place to another.&nbsp; Getting over La Pared (The Wall) is 
				quite difficult at times.&nbsp; I went back and fourth at the 
				base and waited patiently for the periodic volcano of air that 
				eventually breaks off from the ground there.&nbsp; The rest of 
				the tracks all over the countryside are visible.&nbsp; On the 
				far right you can see the track that went through the inversion 
				to 10,600'.&nbsp; After that, it was enough victories for the 
				day so I flew down and went to lunch at Jovan's....<br>

				<p><b>December 10 Valle de Bravo, Mexico</b>  – &nbsp; Yours 
				truly (Had Robinson) set some personal records today… went to 
				10,600+’, the highest this pilot has has ever been in Valle de 
				Bravo nor has this one ever flown above cloud base until today. 
				This altitude was 500’ or so over cloud base. I was able to 
				cruise in and out of the cloud while just staying in the lift. 
				The object is to go into the cloud enough so that you can still 
				see the sun (or a bright spot) but not so far as to experience a 
				“white-out”. I tried to do something like this a few days ago 
				but was going up too close to the center of the cloud and 
				started into “white-out”. Well – that’s the time to take descent 
				maneuvers – which I did.<br>
				<br>
				Cross country here is a challenge as there are not a lot of 
				“cloud streets” and lift is completely dependent on thermals 
				alone – there is no ridge lift as the prevailing winds are 
				little more than breezes. The point of rock in the lower left is 
				El Peñon. It was cold at altitude – I am wearing heavy gloves.&nbsp; 
				I am just about to &quot;white out&quot; here.</p>
