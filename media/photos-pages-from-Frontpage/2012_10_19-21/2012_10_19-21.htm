	<h1>October 20-21, 2012 Amigo Airsho from the Flight Line</h1>
	<p>The El Paso Paramotor Demo Team was on the program this year with (13) other aviation performances from all over the U.S. including the Air Force Thunderbirds and the Army Golden Knights.&nbsp; The 
	team flies the <a href="http://www.flyparamania.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=181&amp;Itemid=100022&amp;lang=en">Paramania GTR powerglider</a> – the best performing 
	reflex glider in the world, especially for air show performances and acrobatics.&nbsp; To read more about the GTR and the team's performance in the air show, go
	<a href="http://blog.flyparamania.com/had-robinson-and-lee-boone-amigo-airshow-oct-20th-21st/">here</a>.</p>

	<p>Why paramotors?&nbsp; First of all, We are unique among the machines that fly.&nbsp; We are the smallest and lightest of all powered aircraft and can do things none other can do such as being able to 
	land or launch virtually anywhere including on/from the sides of mountains.&nbsp; Our typical engine is only 80 cc in size and provides enough thrust for us to climb out.&nbsp; Our typical launch speed is 
	15 mph.&nbsp; Cruise speed is anywhere from 21-25 mph.&nbsp; Top speed is now approaching 50 mph.&nbsp; As an FAA ultralight (FAR 103), we can go to 18,000' MSL but rarely do as it is bitterly cold and we must 
	take oxygen.&nbsp; Our entire aircraft can fit in the trunk of an average sized car.&nbsp; We sip gas – a little less than a gallon an hour.&nbsp; We can safely go for mile after mile just a foot or two off the 
	ground, unencumbered by a lack of roads.&nbsp; This is another reason why paramotors are good for search and rescue in rough terrain as we can usually go very close to the surface, land in small 
	clearings, render aid, call for help, etc.</p>
	<p>We are popular at air shows and balloon fests because of our slow and graceful flight.&nbsp; This allows us to tow very long streamers like we do at the Amigo Airsho – over 700' in length.&nbsp; The Team 
	has developed safe ways to deploy and tow streamers.&nbsp; It has become very popular with the public.</p>
	<p>Crew member, John Shaw, is our photographer (and sky diver) and he was able to get outstanding photos of our recent El Paso Paramotor Demo Team performance from the viewer's perspective.&nbsp; Team 
	members are Glenn Tupper, Lee Boone, &amp; Had Robinson.&nbsp; It took a trained crew to make it all happen.</p>
	<p>The crew (L-R):&nbsp; Melissa Hernandez, Rodrigo Hernandez, Jonathan Chrum, Lee Boone, Bill Cummings, Lance Tripoli, John Shaw, and Had Robinson.&nbsp; Not pictured is our Rio Grande Soaring Association 
	president, Robin Hastings who provides, among other things, expert help with our weather forecasts.</p>
