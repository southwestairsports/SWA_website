		<p><font size="5">Fiesta del Globo 2010, Cd. Chihuahua, Chih., Mexico &amp; 
		Copper Canyon</font></p>
		<p>Marilyn and I were invited by Jose Munoz and the State of Chihuahua 
		to participate in a grand celebration of the Mexican state and to 
		promote powered paragliding at their annual fiesta which includes dozens 
		of hot air balloons, skydiving teams, and powered paragliders and 
		parachutes from the U.S. and Mexico.&nbsp; Here are some photos of the 
		trip...and a bonus tour of the famous Copper Canyon.</p>
		<p><b>November 8 Monday </b>(earlier days are below) - Our host, José 
		Gerardo Muñoz, took the PPG contingent on a tour of the Copper Canyon in 
		Mexico. It is sort of a Grand Canyon times 10, or something like that. 
		It is an astounding place that has just been flown by PPG'ers. We don't 
		think it has been touched by PG. Robin Hastings, president of the RGSA 
		(Rio Grande Soaring Association) and a hang glider pilot, does not think 
		any hang gliders have flown it.</p>
		<p>Below: View east from one of the two hotels at Copper Canyon (Barranca 
		del Cobre).&nbsp; It drops over a mile down to the bottom.<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03395.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>Here is the carved enrty door of the hotel above.&nbsp; Door shape 
		and design are a signature part of most buildings in Mexico, as here.&nbsp; 
		No two are alike.<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03398.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>This is the upper site of the cable car which runs about 1/2 way down 
		to the bottom of the canyon. View is northeast.<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03404.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>View here is south. The arrow to the left points towards the bottom 
		of the canyon (not visible). The arrow to the right is the end of the 
		cable car and it is here that a possible launch site for PG/HG would be 
		possible. The view from there is extraordinary as you can see the bottom 
		and have a straight shot up and down the canyon.&nbsp; <br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03405.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>Jos<font face="Verdana">é Muñoz at the top of the cable car at about 
		7,500'.&nbsp; The system was made in Switzerland.<br>
		</font>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03416.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>This is a view from the bottom of the cable car to the top (black 
		arrow). Another launch area for PG and HG might be to the right of the 
		arrow, towards the end of the ridge. Various parts of this canyon are 
		inhabited by the Tarahumara Indians.<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03427.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>
		The bottom of the canyon is just visible in the lower right. The end of 
		the cable car ride is just in front of Marilyn.<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03428.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>
		View here is south from the end of the cable car ride. If you check the 
		photo above with the white arrows, the one to the right points to just 
		behind where this photo was made. This is a ridge that is exposed on all 
		sides except just in front which has a knob visible here. The prevailing 
		wind is southwest and the bare spot visible here in front might be a 
		perfect place to launch a paraglider or hang glider. More photos 
		follow....<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03436.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>
		I watched the birds here and the knob to the left is a good thermal 
		generator. The view here is southwest and about 100 miles to the ocean 
		and is also the prevailing direction of the winds in Copper Canyon. This 
		photo depicts the area just in front of the photo above. This is a good 
		&quot;bail out&quot; area right in front of launch where a PG pilot could safely 
		stop a launch progression for some reason.<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03430.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>
		If a pilot sank out, there is another bail area (black arrow) that has 
		about 20 acres of fairly flat ground. A flat saddle to the right rear 
		(not visible) might also work. Air was solid coming up the southwest 
		face here. Copper Canyon is not for beginning pilots. Jonathan Jewell is 
		visible here.<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03434.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>
		In this photo (looking southeast), the bottom of the cable car is barely 
		visible (black arrow). Just to the right (white arrow) is the proposed 
		PG/HG launch site that is visible close-up in the above photos. The 
		launch would be into a sort of a &quot;bowl&quot;. The saddle is visible here to 
		the right of the arrows.<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03443.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>
		Below is a view east from the bottom landing area of the cable car. We 
		are looking across the canyon to one of the ridges on the other side. 
		Even here (and much lower) the bottom is not visible.<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03435.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>
		View east from the other hotel in the region.&nbsp; There is actually a 
		third hotel on the rim in the far distance.&nbsp; It would be a grand 
		contest to paraglide across the canyon via thermals and land there and 
		come back.<br>

		Below, Had Robinson practices some kiting.&nbsp; The runway here ends 
		with a thousand foot drop into an abyss.&nbsp; PPG pilots who fly here 
		have to overcome a real fear of the immense heights that immediately 
		come into view when launching.&nbsp; PG/HG pilots have less of a problem 
		with this as they are used to flying in mountains.<br>

		After a breathtaking flight, Dave returns -- it's almost sunset.&nbsp; 
		We 
		can't wait to return here and study the sites more carefully and <b>FLY 
		COPPER CANYON</b>!<br>

		<p><b>November 7 Sunday </b>- We continued with 
		the celebration on Sunday. Remember, most of the balloonists you see in 
		the photo below are from the United States. We need to have many more 
		PPG pilots and their gear in the future. I am looking forward to next 
		year and bringing our gear, especially the foot 
		launched Miniplane.</p>
		<p>Today we left for Creel, Mexico - named after the American who helped 
		build the railroad down through the Copper Canyon - one of the wonders 
		of the world.<br>

		<p><b>November 6 Saturday</b></p>
		<p>The Fiesta continued here!&nbsp; Enjoy.</p>
		<p>Cd. Chihuahua is far enough south and on the southern side of the 
		great mesa of here and El Paso.&nbsp; Therefore, it rarely freezes here 
		and many more kinds of beautiful plants can grow in the gardens.</p>
