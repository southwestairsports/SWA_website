				<p><b>February 18 Saturday  –  Sod Farm &amp; Franklin Mountains 
				Gangbusters</b>  –  Cybele Christine &amp; Jose Mu<font face="Verdana">ñoz 
				were our heroes at the sod farm today  –  our winch was out of 
				commission so it was a kiting day.&nbsp; But it could not have 
				been better  –  a gentle breeze coming in from the north around 
				4-6 mph.&nbsp; The pilots practiced &quot;variation 3&quot;&nbsp;  –  a way 
				to hold the glider in complete control when at launch (or 
				kiting).&nbsp; Both pilots were able to do forward launches in 
				the gentle air.&nbsp; Overall, it was a day of glider handling 
				#101.&nbsp; If a pilot learns how to handle his glider on the 
				ground, he can handle it in the air.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana">Then it was gangbusters in the Franklin 
		Mountains! Instructor Had Robinson launched from Agave Hill in perfect 
		conditions: The air was coming in around 5-8 mph right out of the west. 
		Agave behaved in perfect form. A pilot must turn north from launch and 
		get a few hundred feet over launch before turning south and getting the 
		&quot;big lift&quot; out in front of the Triangle. Today was not strong aloft so 
		you had to be patient getting up in the Triangle. The thermals have a 
		period of about 5 minutes so you cannot give up. Once at the top of the 
		Franklins, Had decided to do some cross country and went south along the 
		range as far as he could without having to land downtown somewhere. 
		Today with the west winds, he got within about 2 miles of Stanton 
		Street. When a pilot passes Coronado Country Club the range makes a 
		dog-leg more southeast and the crest drops dramatically. It can fool you 
		– a pilot thinks he is still high but he is sinking down and will fight 
		upwind all the way back. Only one pilot has ever made the round trip 
		from Agave all the way to the end of the Franklins and back.</font></p>

		<p><font size="2">Below, Had Robinson soars over the Franklin Mountains 
		south of Transmountain Pass Road and McKelligon Canyon.&nbsp; It was 
		gangbusters  –  today:&nbsp; Training at the sod farm and then incredible 
		soaring in the Franklin Mountains.&nbsp; View is east with northeast El 
		Paso in the background.<br>

		<p><font size="2">Out in front of N. Mount Franklin looking SSE.&nbsp; 
		The ridge from the peak goes down quickly to Transmountain Pass.&nbsp; 
		Secret Hill is the last bump in the ridge before it descends to 
		Transmountain. (If you are coming north, you must at least be the height 
		of Secret Hill if you want to successfully cross the Dragon's Mouth (the 
		pass) at 
		Transmountain.)<br>

		<p><font size="2">Flying over Transmountain Pass  –  looking straight 
		down.&nbsp; The top of the photo is east and the pass is clearly visible 
		where the rock has been cut away next to the road.&nbsp; Pilots must 
		always be wary crossing the Dragon's Mouth as it is easy to get sucked 
		into the vortex created by the pass.&nbsp; At least one pilot has gotten 
		trapped and had an unfortunate outcome....<br>

		<p><font size="2">The southern end of the Franklin Mountains.&nbsp; I 
		got just about as far as the radio tower in the foreground but had to

		<p><font size="2">Below is an image of the track log of today's flight.&nbsp; 
		Notice how long it took to get up at the Triangle and how far down the 
		range the pilot went.&nbsp; This flight was a classic Agave  –  fly north 
		from launch, get high in the house thermal, turn south, work up at the 
		Triangle  –  and the sky is yours!&nbsp; The blip to the left in the 
		Triangle was a safety measure.&nbsp; The pilot had no idea if the sudden 
		lift experienced there was from higher (and dangerous) winds aloft or a 
		powerful thermal rolling in.&nbsp; It was a powerful thermal, especially 
		for so late in the day when thermals tend to be weak.&nbsp; Generally, 
		the thermals were modest (&lt;600'/min).<br>

		<p>Hope you enjoyed the show!&nbsp; Come and learn from us how to fly 
		places like this safely.</p></td>
