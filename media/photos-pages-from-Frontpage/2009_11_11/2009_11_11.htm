		<b><font size="5">Mt. Riley - Thermal &amp; Soaring Paradise</font></b><p>
		<font size="5">November 11, 2009</font></p>
		<p>Pilots Lee Boone &amp; Had Robinson set off for the hike 'n fly up Mt. 
		Riley to launch in ideal soaring &amp; thermalling conditions.&nbsp; Careful 
		study of the atmospheric soundings (<a href="../../../../Weather/WeatherIntro/WeatherIntro.htm">SkewT</a>) 
		are very helpful for soaring pilots - our thanks to the National Weather 
		Service.</p>
		<p>Both pilots were rewarded.&nbsp; Lee set a record for in air time in 
		the region of 2 hours.&nbsp; Had set an altitude record for the region 
		of almost 9,000'.&nbsp; This is the high desert and conditions can be 
		very strong so we are always careful.</p>
		<p>Below is an image of Had's flight.&nbsp; The wavy lines on the right 
		are actually tight circles made by the pilot in order to stay in the 
		thermal.&nbsp; Notice how the thermal here drifts back in the direction 
		of the wind.&nbsp; Because it is late fall and the atmosphere was 
		cooling at a modest rate with a gain in altitude, the thermals were not 
		strong.&nbsp; This is why the thermal paths are not very vertical.&nbsp; 
		Had flew in multiple thermals, as seen below.&nbsp; </p>
		<p><img border="0" src="MtRileythermal.jpg" width="1028" height="729"></p>
		<p>There was an inversion at 11,500' so top altitude was limited.&nbsp; 
		It was easily visible at 9,000' -- an eerie sight.&nbsp; While Had could 
		have gone up another 1,500' or so, pilots flying in this remote region 
		need to stay together for safety.&nbsp; As he was drifting north over 
		the mountains and out of sight, he left the thermal he was in and headed 
		back south.</p>
		<p>Lee Boone stayed in ridge lift in front of Mt. Riley until the sun 
		was gone.&nbsp; Had improvised an &quot;aircraft beacon&quot; and &quot;runway light&quot; 
		using the old &quot;ground fire&quot; technique.&nbsp; It served multiple duty by 
		also being a wind direction indicator (a.k.a. smoke drift).&nbsp; As Lee 
		was landing. the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katabatic_wind">katabatic</a> flow off the mountains really kicked in.&nbsp; In high 
		mountains, this flow can really complicate landing making it a downwind 
		landing and &quot;hot.&quot;&nbsp; In some parts of Alaska, this flow can exceed 
		160 mph.&nbsp; The famous Santa Ana winds of southern California are 
		also katabatic winds.</p>
		<p>Had cruised the mountains in the area, exploring the south and west 
		face of Mt. Cox for the first time.&nbsp; Mt. Riley has fewer deep 
		canyons which improves the lift there.&nbsp; Cox might be good in strong 
		west winds, nonetheless.&nbsp; Riley's cone shape still provides the 
		best possibilities for convergence of ridge lift and thermals.</p>
		<p>We hiked to the top with full gear - it was a chore!&nbsp; Lee hiked 
		to the top <i>twice</i> as he sank out the first time and wanted a 
		chance to soar again.&nbsp; He had success!</p>
		<p>A short video of the flight is

		<p>&quot;Hi!&quot; from Had.&nbsp; Mt. Riley is in the lower left of the photo.&nbsp; 
		Lift was everywhere out in front of Riley.&nbsp; Its conical shape 
		funnels thermals up from the base and they shoot up over the top of the 
		mountain.&nbsp; Had is in a thermal which regularly pops off a conical 
		hill that is just south of Riley.</p>

		<p>Lee just landed.&nbsp; &quot;Where is the LZ?&nbsp; I can't see it!&quot;</p>
		<p>
		<img border="0" src="DSC02384.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>Lee was freezing from the cold air above Riley so getting warm by our 
		&quot;airport beacon&quot;, &quot;runway light&quot;, and &quot;wind speed/direction indicator&quot; 
		was very pleasant!</p>
