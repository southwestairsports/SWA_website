				<p><b>May 29 Tuesday  –  Northeastern Oklahoma</b>  –  Powered 
				paragliding has few of the exciting challenges or the 
				peacefulness of cross-country free flight but it sure has one 
				thing: CONVENIENCE. If the photo below was from a cross country 
				flight, the pilot would be setting up to land! Under power, we 
				can go for mile after mile a few hundred feet above the terrain, 
				taking it all in in close-up fashion. So, I took another trip 
				and went to the dam that created Lake Tenkiller. Rather than fly 
				along the lake shore, I flew south from Tahlequah, OK over a 
				dirt road that went for over 20 miles through the bucolic 
				countryside on my way to the Tenkiller dam. Living in El Paso, 
				it is easy to forget that some areas of the country are &quot;green&quot;, 
				a strange color but prevalent in other parts of the world. Below 
				is &quot;country roads&quot; revisited in the peaceful backcountry of NE 
				Oklahoma.</p>

				<p>Mile after mile I flew straight south over this dirt road 
				which, at various times, petered out and popped up again.&nbsp; On 
				either side were various ranches and farms.&nbsp; To the left in the 
				far distance is the former Illinois River valley which is now 
				Lake Tenkiller.</p>
		<p>

		<p>This one property had a hidden nook where an inviting swimming hole 
		with a diving board could be found.&nbsp; I suppose if I had landed 
		there, the owners might have permitted a dip.&nbsp; The people in the 
		region are friendly and helpful.</p>
		<p>

		<p>As I went south, the Lake turned more to the southwest and became 
		visible.&nbsp; Why didn't I fly down the Lake?&nbsp; Trees go right down 
		to the shoreline!&nbsp; If a pilot has an engine out, where would he land?&nbsp; Drowning is the #1 cause of death for PPG pilots so I 
		wished to avoid the possibility.</p>
		<p>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_0141.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>A beautiful country estate about 4 miles west of the lake near its south end.&nbsp; 
		There are no trains, no freeways, and the area is removed from any 
		common flight paths.&nbsp; This means one thing:&nbsp; Quiet (my flying 
		over didn't help but it certainly was a novelty, in any case.)</p>
		<p>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_0144.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>I wanted to see the dam.&nbsp; In order to safely cross the Lake 
		(where landing on the shore would not be safe or easy), a pilot would have to climb 
		up to an altitude high enough to glide to a safe LZ  –  which I did here.&nbsp; 
		The dam is just to the right of the photo.</p>
		<p>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_0146.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>Lake Tenkiller dam  –  few realize that there is a small hydroelectric 
		plant at the dam (the brown roofed structure in front of a white 
		silo-like tower in the photo below).&nbsp; Those who look closely will 
		note that the there is no overflow at the dam.&nbsp; Conditions all 
		across the southwest and central plains have been very dry.&nbsp; This 
		part of Oklahoma has had but 20% of the normal rainfall for this time of 
		year.</p>
		<p>

				<p>
		The &quot;wash&quot; from the generators is clearly visible in the photo below.&nbsp; 
		The lake is about 10' lower than normal.</p>
		<p>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_0150.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>After the 1 1/2 hour flight to the dam, I decided to land 
		and relax at in open field about 3 miles northeast of the dam.&nbsp; The 
		Lake is about 100 yd. beyond the tree line in the distance.&nbsp; A 
		curious onlooker could not believe it when I dropped out of the sky.</p>
		<p>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20IMG_0151.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>After relaxing for about an hour, I re-launched in the nearly dead 
		air and high-tailed it back to Tahlequah.&nbsp; The sky west of this 
		area was starting to darken (visible in the photo above to the left).&nbsp; 
		Soon, the weather would overdevelop and it would not be smart to be caught 
		in any possible outflow from towering clouds dumping a million tons of 
		cold air to the ground.&nbsp; Flying the Paramania Revo2 (reflex) 
		glider is a joy as a pilot can let the trimmers all the way out and 
		still go on full speed bar with great confidence.&nbsp; Top speed going 
		back (about 20 miles as the crow flies) was over 40 m.p.h.</p>
				<p>Learning first how to paraglide without a motor is a good 
				plan for safety.&nbsp; As an instructor, I am amazed at the 
				number of avoidable accidents PPG pilots experience because they 
				choose to do any sort of maneuver near the ground (less than 
				500' AGL).&nbsp; For example, when I returned to Tahlequah on 
				full speed bar with the trimmers completely out, I had over 
				2000' of altitude above the ground  –  just in case.&nbsp; While 
				98% of the time we would have nothing to worry about, we need to 
				be at 100%.&nbsp; Why be among the 2% that experience problems 
				and then get drilled into the ground, as someone recently did at 
				the Beach Blast in Florida?</p>
				<p>Experienced pilots and instructors know what can happen and 
				that is why we take consistent measures to avoid risk.</p>
		<p>I hope you enjoyed the show!</p></td>
