				<p><font size="2"><b>July 14  –  Ski Apache - Sierra Blanca  – </b> 
				Ruidoso, New Mexico residents Riker Davis and his son, Tucker, 
				are long time hang glider and paraglider pilots, respectively, 
				and have worked tirelessly for years to develop this matchless 
				area for hang gliding and paragliding.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2">Riker, a former employee of Ski Apache, and Justin 
		Rowland, Director of Operations of the resort, teamed up to open this 
		popular ski attraction to commercial tandem flights for visitors.&nbsp; 
		This is where Had Robinson, a USHPA advanced and tandem instructor came 
		in to the mix:&nbsp; Someone was needed who could legally give tandem 
		flights.&nbsp; What now has to happen is the area must be flown solo 
		countless times by experienced pilots in order to learn the air with 
		certainty.&nbsp; This is necessary for the complete safety of passengers 
		who want to enjoy the skies near the tallest mountain in the southwest.&nbsp; 
		Accordingly, Tucker and Had dove right in that Friday morning to fly
		<a href="http://www.skiapache.com/">Ski Apache</a>.&nbsp; We started 
		first with launching from the top of the
		<a href="http://www.skiapache.com/the-mountain/trail-map/">Capitan 
		Triple Chair #4 lift </a>and landing in the main parking lot at the base 
		of the ski area.&nbsp; We will also begin flying from the very top of 
		the ski area near Apache Bowl Triple Chair #6 lift (over 11,000' MSL).</font></p>
		<p><font size="2">Tucker made the first paraglider flight ever inside 
		Ski Apache and Had made the second.&nbsp; HD YouTube videos of both 
		flights can be viewed
		<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMql0uVbUvg">here</a> (Tucker) 
		and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i6szul0q3g">here</a> (Had).&nbsp; 
		It looks easy but this is launching and landing in a deep canyon in the 
		highest mountains of south central New Mexico.&nbsp; Prevailing winds 
		here are a danger as we must rely on wind currents driven by the sun's 
		convective heat hitting the east slopes of the range.&nbsp; Everyone 
		hopes that Tucker will get his commercial tandem instructor 
		certification soon.&nbsp; We need more capable pilots!</font></p>
		<p><font size="2">BTW, if you need to rent a cabin in the Ruidoso area, 
		reserve a ski package, and the like, Riker (owner of Condotel Corp) is 
		your man.&nbsp; Contact him at: 800-545-9017
		or visit his website
		<a href="http://www.ruidosoreservations.com">www.ruidosoreservations.com</a>.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2">Below, Tucker and his dad, Riker, contemplate the 
		flight from what would be the highest accessible launch site in the 
		southwest  –  over 11,000' MSL.&nbsp; The 12,000' Sierra Blanca looms in 
		the background.&nbsp; It was cold up there  –  52 degrees.&nbsp; (For my 
		fellow residents in and near El Paso, does &quot;cold&quot; sound like an odd word 
		to you in the middle of July?)<br>

		<p><font size="2">Looking northeast from the top of Apache Bowl to Buck 
		Mountain (10,700').&nbsp; Now wouldn't this be a sled ride to the bottom 
		 –  over 1.5 miles of vertical drop?&nbsp; The Capitan Mountains are 
		visible in the far distance.&nbsp; Our challenge in flying the Bowl is 
		to have enough good lift to clear the saddle (white arrow) on our way 
		down to the LZ (the base of the ski area).&nbsp; This base is not 
		visible here as it lies in a deep canyon beyond the ridge visible here 
		going from left to right.<br>

		<p><font size="2">Tucker laying out his glider for the historic flight 
		from northeast/east facing slope at the top of the Capitan lift.&nbsp; 
		Remember that winds aloft here are from the southwest.&nbsp; How will 
		they affect the lower air currents that result from convection and are 
		from the east?&nbsp; Will there be ripping turbulence or rotor when we 
		launch? Or?&nbsp; This is why pioneering site work can be dicey.&nbsp; 
		Did I forget something???&nbsp; In other words, it takes manhood to do 
		this kind of stuff....<br>

		<p><font size="2">The air was buoyant right off launch and Tucker got 
		right up.&nbsp; Predictably, the dark parking lot was throwing off 
		significant thermals.&nbsp; Had Robinson launched to the right (see the 
		video above) and was able to get even more lift as he entered a thermal 
		that followed along the top of the trees to the right.&nbsp; However, 
		today was not the day to thermal out of the ski area  –  next time, 
		maybe.<br>
		</font>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC00795.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p><font size="2">In a thermic area like this parking lot, winds are 
		light and variable  –  if you don't get popped by a powerful thermal 
		coming off the hot asphalt.&nbsp; Tucker was able to fly all the way to 
		the east (right) end of the parking lot and all the way back to the west 
		end and land  –  going slightly uphill.&nbsp; This is because cold air is 
		still pouring down the sides of these mountains nearly all morning.&nbsp; 
		When Had landed a half hour later, air was still coming down the 
		mountain.&nbsp; His chosen LZ was sloping down the mountain and he 
		landed downwind  –  it was quite a run.&nbsp; But we are learning about 
		the site and where a safe tandem could be flown and where to land.&nbsp; 
		Again, pioneering sites can be dicey.<br>

		<p><font size="2">The happy pilots Tucker and Had (in hat) posing at the 
		entrance to Ski Apache (currently closed, however, because of the 
		drought and fire danger.&nbsp; It will open soon because we had good 
		rains recently.&nbsp; WE HAD FAR MORE FUN DOING THIS THAN ANY NORMAL 
		PERSON IS ALLOWED TO HAVE.&nbsp; Imagine getting the privilege of flying 
		one of the highest spots in the southwest?<br>
		</font>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSC00799.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p><font size="2">Windy Point Launch (10,050' MSL)&nbsp;  –  The green 
		arrows point to launch area. The left arrow has a rugged launch but is 
		right on the road to Ski Apache.&nbsp; The right arrow points to a huge 
		grassy saddle for an easy launch but you have to hike about 10 minutes 
		to get there.&nbsp; The photo was taken in the LZ which is an easy 2:1 
		sled ride from launch (2,000' above the LZ).&nbsp; The launch (east of 
		the peak of Buck Mountain) could be a prime site for paragliding in New 
		Mexico.&nbsp; As it faces east, it is protected from the stronger and 
		higher winds aloft by the peaks west of it.&nbsp; Like the air at Ski 
		Apache, it relies on convection from the sun to get an upslope breeze.&nbsp; 
		Once pilots get up, they can thermal away to ? or ride the ridge lift 
		out in front of launch.&nbsp; The Mescalero Apache Indian Tribe has 
		generously offered their help in making this entire area flyable.&nbsp; 
		We are very thankful for their willingness to see hang gliders and 
		paragliders above the Reservation.<br>

		<p><font size="2">Interesting asides...&nbsp; The bathroom below is not 
		in some beautiful custom home in Ruidoso.&nbsp; It is the public 
		restroom in a local market and restaurant in downtown Ruidoso called 
		&quot;The Wild Herb Market&quot;.&nbsp; I don't think this writer had ever been in 
		a public restroom as clean and decked out as this one....&nbsp; BTW, the 
		food was excellent and fresh.<br>
