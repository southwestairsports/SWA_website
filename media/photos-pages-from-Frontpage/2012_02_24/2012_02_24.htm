				<p><b>February 24 Friday - Gangbusters Part II in the Potrillo 
				Mountains</b>  –  Paragliding is like surfing a bit: You get out 
				in the water.&nbsp; You may be early but what a disappointment 
				if you are too late!&nbsp; Better to wait around at &quot;launch&quot; 
				than to watch a dream wave come along while you are on the 
				beach.&nbsp; Well, pilots Lee Boone, Bele Christine, Had 
				Robinson, and the KFOX Channel 14 camera crew barely got out to 
				the 
				<a href="../../../../SiteInfo/EastPotrilloMtns/e_potrillo_mtns.htm">East Potrillo Mountains</a> in time  –  that's when I (Had) 
				thought, &quot;We are like surfers and we almost missed the wave!&quot;</p>
		<p>Below, ace reporter, Bernadette Flores of KFOX News; intrepid pilot 
		adventurer, Lee Boone; Bele Christine (not pictured here), and wanna-be 
		record-setter, paragliding instructor, and all around &quot;crank&quot;, Had 
		Robinson just before our flight in the Potrillo's.&nbsp; How do we have 
		any more fun than this:&nbsp; Flying places no man has ever flown 
		before???<br>

		<p>Bele and Had  –  we who paraglide are all best 
		friends.&nbsp; Bele did not fly today but she helped us 
		launch.&nbsp; For this the active pilots are extremely thankful as 
		safety always is better with help.<br>

		<p>Lee &amp; Had on their way to Torrey Paso launch.&nbsp; The packs 
		weigh 55 lbs. each.<br>

				<p>Both pilots had perfect launches from Torrey Paso.&nbsp; 
				Below is Had's launch.&nbsp; Note the symmetrical shape of the 
				glider which is fully inflated.&nbsp; When setting up on the 
				ground, careful inspection of the lines is a must.&nbsp; A 
				single line can snag on a bush or a sharp rock and spoil the 
				launch which can also damage the glider.&nbsp; The harness looks 
				very large but is, in fact, a ram inflatable air bag  –  in case 
				of mishap.&nbsp; We launched safely, soared the bowl in front of 
				Torrey Paso launch, and then landed.&nbsp; This was a 
				&quot;hike-n-fly&quot; event and was worth 20 minute trip to launch.<br>

				<p>Had is heading north along the crest of the range.&nbsp; It 
				was the end of the day and the thermals  –  sniff  –  were going 
				away.<br>
		<img border="0" src="Copy%20of%20DSCN0393.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
				<p>Below is our friendly barrel cactus.&nbsp; It looks 
				frightening but, by cactus standards, is more passive.&nbsp; The 
				spines are not barbed on the ends nor do they contain poison 
				unlike the prickly pear and the cholla which both are nasty if 
				you just touch them.&nbsp; The yellow pods at the top of the 
				cactus are mature seed pods each of which has hundreds of small 
				black seeds about 1/3 the size of a grain of rice.&nbsp; Bele 
				has placed her foot at the base to give an idea of its size.<br>

				<p>Lee and Bele sitting at the LZ at the base of the range.&nbsp; 
				Lee is sitting in his flying harness enjoying the quiet late 
				afternoon miles from nowhere.<br>

				<p>Our signature mark of soaring pilots in the vicinity: The 
				windsock.&nbsp; This one will show air moving just a fraction of 
				a mile per hour.&nbsp; We always want to launch or land into the 
				wind.<br>
