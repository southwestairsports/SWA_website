				<b>April 26 Tuesday  –  Spring Fling </b> –  <b>The Triangle of 
		Doom</b>  –  Cruising along high over the Central Florida landscape.&nbsp; 
		At this moment, I am turning in a thermal in order to stay in it.&nbsp; 
		The skill in this sport is to find lift going up and not fly out of it.&nbsp; 
		You can't see the thermal but your instruments can tell you via sound 
		when you are near it and in it.&nbsp; When the thermals are strong, you 
		can feel them  –  of course.&nbsp; It is all a learned skill unlike 
		anything else.&nbsp; The vultures and other soaring birds are experts 
		and we follow and watch them, too.&nbsp; You can see another glider in 
		the upper right.&nbsp; He and I are flying together and working the same 
		lift.&nbsp; He went on to win the day  –  I took a chance and sank 
		out...as you can see below.<br>

				Winds were driving pilots to the northeast when we needed to be 
		going north.&nbsp; I left good lift and a fellow pilot to see if I could 
		dart across a &quot;blue hole&quot; to the other side and get more on track for 
		goal.&nbsp; A blue hole is a blue patch of sky which is reputed to be 
		without any lift anywhere whatsoever.&nbsp; Well, that is the truth.&nbsp; 
		I landed in the middle of a 100.000 acre cattle ranch and had to walk 
		out with my gear - about 5 miles.&nbsp; It was an interesting hike out.&nbsp; 
		This ranch is also known as &quot;The Triangle of Doom&quot; because if you land 
		in it, there is no way for you to be picked up.&nbsp; In the photo 
		below, I just landed and knew it was going to be a long day with a 55 lb 
		pack.&nbsp; But what can you do?&nbsp; It was an unexpected hike as far 
		as the eye could see so why not enjoy it?<br>

		up the other pilots.&nbsp; The thunderstorm had come and we are getting 
		rained on.&nbsp; It was 5 more pilots to go who had landed in the middle 
		of nowhere.&nbsp; Brita ensures that the pilots are in a good mood after 
		they are picked up.<br>
