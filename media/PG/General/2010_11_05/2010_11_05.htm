	<h1>Fiesta del Globo 2010 Mexico</h1>
	<p>Marilyn and I were invited by Jose Munoz and the State of Chihuahua to participate in a grand celebration of the Mexican state and to promote powered paragliding at their annual fiesta which 
	includes dozens of hot air balloons, skydiving teams, and powered paragliders and parachutes from the U.S. and Mexico.&nbsp; Here are some photos of the trip...and a bonus tour of the famous 
	Copper Canyon.</p>
	<h2>November 8 Monday (earlier days are below)</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;Our host, José Gerardo Muñoz, took the PPG contingent on a tour of the Copper Canyon in Mexico. It is sort of a Grand Canyon times 10, or something like that. It is an astounding place 
	that has just been flown by PPG'ers. We don't think it has been touched by PG. Robin Hastings, president of the RGSA (Rio Grande Soaring Association) and a hang glider pilot, does not think any 
	hang gliders have flown it.</p>
	<p>Below: View east from one of the two hotels at Copper Canyon (Barranca del Cobre).&nbsp; It drops over a mile down to the bottom.</p>
	<p><img alt="Copper Canyon, Mexico" height="768" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03395.JPG" width="1024"></p>
	<p>Here is the carved entry door of the hotel above.&nbsp; Door shape and design are a signature part of most buildings in Mexico, as here.&nbsp; No two are alike. </p>
	<p><img alt="hotel door in Copper Canyon, Mexico" height="768" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03398.JPG" width="1024"></p>
	<p>This is the upper site of the cable car which runs about 1/2 way down to the bottom of the canyon. View is northeast. </p>
	<p><img alt="Copper Canyon, Mexico" height="768" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03404.JPG" width="1024"></p>
	<p>View here is south. The arrow to the left points towards the bottom of the canyon (not visible). The arrow to the right is the end of the cable car and it is here that a possible launch site 
	for PG/HG would be possible. The view from there is extraordinary as you can see the bottom and have a straight shot up and down the canyon.&nbsp; </p>
	<p><img alt="Copper Canyon, Mexico" height="768" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03405.JPG" width="1024"></p>
	<p>José Muñoz at the top of the cable car at about 7,500'.&nbsp; The system was made in Switzerland. </p>
	<p><img alt="cable car in Copper Canyon, Mexico" height="768" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03416.JPG" width="1024"></p>
	<p>This is a view from the bottom of the cable car to the top (black arrow). Another launch area for PG and HG might be to the right of the arrow, towards the end of the ridge. Various parts of 
	this canyon are inhabited by the Tarahumara Indians. </p>
	<p><img alt="Copper Canyon, Mexico" height="768" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03427.JPG" width="1024"></p>
	<p>The bottom of the canyon is just visible in the lower right. The end of the cable car ride is just in front of Marilyn. </p>
	<p><img alt="Copper Canyon, Mexico" height="768" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03428.JPG" width="1024"></p>
	<p>View here is south from the end of the cable car ride. If you check the photo above with the white arrows, the one to the right points to just behind where this photo was made. This is a ridge 
	that is exposed on all sides except just in front which has a knob visible here. The prevailing wind is southwest and the bare spot visible here in front might be a perfect place to launch a 
	paraglider or hang glider. More photos follow.... </p>
	<p><img alt="Copper Canyon, Mexico" height="768" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03436.JPG" width="1024"></p>
	<p>I watched the birds here and the knob to the left is a good thermal generator. The view here is southwest and about 100 miles to the ocean and is also the prevailing direction of the winds in 
	Copper Canyon. This photo depicts the area just in front of the photo above. This is a good "bail out" area right in front of launch where a PG pilot could safely stop a launch progression for 
	some reason. </p>
	<p><img alt="Copper Canyon, Mexico" height="768" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03430.JPG" width="1024"></p>
	<p>If a pilot sank out, there is another bail area (black arrow) that has about 20 acres of fairly flat ground. A flat saddle to the right rear (not visible) might also work. Air was solid coming 
	up the southwest face here. Copper Canyon is not for beginning pilots. Jonathan Jewell is visible here. </p>
	<p><img alt="Copper Canyon, Mexico" height="768" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03434.JPG" width="1024"></p>
	<p>In this photo (looking southeast), the bottom of the cable car is barely visible (black arrow). Just to the right (white arrow) is the proposed PG/HG launch site that is visible close-up in the 
	above photos. The launch would be into a sort of a "bowl". The saddle is visible here to the right of the arrows. </p>
	<p><img alt="Copper Canyon, Mexico" height="768" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03443.JPG" width="1024"></p>
	<p>Below is a view east from the bottom landing area of the cable car. We are looking across the canyon to one of the ridges on the other side. Even here (and much lower) the bottom is not 
	visible. </p>
	<p><img alt="Copper Canyon, Mexico" height="768" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03435.JPG" width="1024"></p>
	<p>View east from the other hotel in the region.&nbsp; There is actually a third hotel on the rim in the far distance.&nbsp; It would be a grand contest to paraglide across the canyon via thermals 
	and land there and come back. </p>
	<p><img alt="Copper Canyon, Mexico" height="768" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03445.JPG" width="1024"></p>

	<p>Below, Had Robinson practices some kiting.&nbsp; The runway here ends with a thousand foot drop into an abyss.&nbsp; PPG pilots who fly here have to overcome a real fear of the immense heights 
	that immediately come into view when launching.&nbsp; PG/HG pilots have less of a problem with this as they are used to flying in mountains. </p>

	<p>David Jewell of Blue Sky PPG launches his Adventure Trike from the runway.&nbsp; It faces northeast (the direction we are looking here) to southwest. </p>

	<p>After a breathtaking flight, Dave returns -- it's almost sunset.&nbsp; We can't wait to return here and study the sites more carefully and FLY COPPER CANYON! </p>

	<h2>November 7 Sunday</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;We continued with the celebration on Sunday. Remember, most of the balloonists you see in the photo below are from the United States. We need to have many more PPG pilots and their gear 
	in the future. I am looking forward to next year and bringing our gear, especially the foot launched Miniplane.</p>
	<p>Today we left for Creel, Mexico - named after the American who helped build the railroad down through the Copper Canyon - one of the wonders of the world. </p>
	<p><img alt="Fiesta del Globo Mexico 2010" height="768" src="Copy%20of%20DSC03381.JPG" width="1024"></p>

	<a href="http://www.blueskyppg.com/">Blue Sky PPG</a> in California;&nbsp; Had Robinson of Southwest Airsports &amp; El Paso Paragliding; and our gracious host, José Muñoz.&nbsp; José and Had plan to 
	establish some more formal PPG training in Chihuahua, Mexico.&nbsp; </p>

	<p>Our room at the Creel Best Western Lodge.&nbsp; We are at about 8,000' here -- they had a frost the night before.&nbsp; Creel is located on the edge of the Copper Canyon.&nbsp; The box beneath 
	Marilyn's hand is a gas powered stove. </p>

	<h2>November 6 Saturday</h2>
	<p>The Fiesta continued here!&nbsp; Enjoy.</p>
	<p>Cd. Chihuahua is far enough south and on the southern side of the great mesa of here and El Paso.&nbsp; Therefore, it rarely freezes here and many more kinds of beautiful plants can grow in the 
	gardens.</p>

	<p>In Mexico, the doors of a casa or a business are like the face -- every one is different and often a work of art, as below.&nbsp; This is the entrance to a restaurant in the city.</p>

	<p>Below is the living room of family relatives of our host, Jose Munoz.&nbsp; The powered paragliding pilots and crew (four of us) were invited for snacks here late in the evening.&nbsp; The 
	ceiling is of carved wood, about 18' high.</p>
