	<h1>Introduction to Flying Sites in the Southwest</h1>
		<p>All pilots must carefully study the weather forecasts (especially the 
		raw balloon data) that are available on the front page of this web site 
		before flying in this&nbsp; region.&nbsp; Your safety depends on it.&nbsp; 
		You can study our <a href="../weather/weather-intro/WeatherIntro.htm">
		introduction to southwest weather</a> if you need help.<br><br>It is 
		important to note that overhead disturbances, thermal activity, and the 
		Jet stream can greatly affect our flying in the region.&nbsp; Thermals 
		and atmospheric disturbances can cause the Jet to mix down to the 
		surface and cause dangerous sheer turbulence.&nbsp; If you see any 
		gusting in the
		<a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?w0=t&amp;w3=sfcwind&amp;w3u=1&amp;w12u=1&amp;w13u=1&amp;AheadHour=0&amp;Submit=Submit&amp;FcstType=graphical&amp;textField1=31.87330&amp;textField2=-106.64100&amp;site=all&amp;unit=0">
		hourly forecasts</a> and the
		<a href="http://virga.sfsu.edu/gif/jetstream_init_00.gif">Jet</a> is 
		overhead, our experience is:&nbsp;stay on the ground  –  unless you want to
		<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxryXl8n-zw">rock and roll</a>.&nbsp; 
		In general, it is best to stay on the ground if there is any gusting in 
		the forecasts.<br>&nbsp;<br><a href="DryCanyon/DryCanyon.htm">Dry Canyon</a> 
		is our most consistently good site.&nbsp; It is a better hang gliding 
		than paragliding site because of the intense thermals that drift up the 
		canyon.&nbsp; The PG launch at Dry is a 15 minute hike south of the main 
		HG launch.&nbsp; The downside of Dry is that it is minimum of 40 minutes 
		to drive to launch.<br>&nbsp;<br>If the winds are east:&nbsp; We have three 
		sites in NM:&nbsp; The <a href="EastPotrilloMtns/e_potrillo_mtns.htm">
		East Potrillo Mountains</a>, <a href="MtRiley/MtRiley.htm">Mt. Riley</a>, 
		and <a href="Anapra/anapra.htm">Anapra</a>.&nbsp; Anapra can be driven 
		to but a guide is necessary as we have to pass through private land to 
		get to launch.&nbsp; Alternately, if you drive to the LZ out in front, 
		you can hike up the hill and will not have to pass through private land.&nbsp; 
		Mt. Riley is a spectacular site but it is a 40 minute hike for pilots 
		who are in good shape – it is a true “hike ‘n fly”.&nbsp; The East 
		Potrillo Mountains involve a short hike of about 15 minutes to Torrey 
		Paso or you can drive to the BC launch at the southern end.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>
		If the winds are southwesterly or west:&nbsp;
		<a href="MattsMountain/mattsmountain.htm">Magdalena Rim</a> and
		<a href="KilbourneHoleMaar/kilbourne.htm">Kilbourne Hole maar</a> are 
		fun soaring sites.&nbsp; <a href="Agave/agave.htm">Agave Hill</a> is a 
		12 minute hike and <a href="LeesLookout/LeesLookout.htm">Lee’s Lookout</a> 
		is about the same.&nbsp; Agave has a safer launch but does not work as 
		well when winds are light.&nbsp; Lee's is virtually guaranteed soaring 
		in the Franklins if you can get off launch.&nbsp; Mt. Riley is workable 
		with winds from north to east to southwest.&nbsp; Southeast is best.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>If the winds are weak to moderate from any direction:&nbsp;
		<a href="NMtFranklin/NMtFnkln.htm">North Mt. Franklin </a>is a 2.5 hour 
		hike to the top but if conditions are weak everywhere, it is a 
		guaranteed flight with a tremendous view and the ability to stay up 
		until dark (even in weak conditions) because of thermals merging 
		southwest of the peak.&nbsp; Always check winds aloft at 9K’ to be sure 
		that they are under 18 mph in order to safely launch!<br>&nbsp;<br>We ask 
		that all visiting pilots to donate at least $10/day to the
		<a href="http://www.rgsa.info/">RGSA</a> for the use any of our insured 
		sites (Dry Canyon, La Luz, Windy Point, &amp; Franklin Mountains State 
		Park).&nbsp; If a pilot flies three days or more, he should join as a 
		regular member.</p>
