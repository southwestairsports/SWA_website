	<h2>IMPORTANT NOTICE</h2>
	<p>Launching from the steep slopes and cliffs in the 
	desert mountains requires good kiting skills. It is hazardous to inflate and 
	then immediately turn before stabilizing your glider overhead for a few 
	seconds or more. Many pilots have damaged their equipment and been banged-up 
	attempting to launch in the often turbulent air that characterizes the air 
	we fly in. Pilots must have the skills to kite a glider overhead under 
	control before attempting a launch, especially in strong air. In addition, 
	all pilots should master inflating their gliders with the A's in one hand 
	and the C's or D's in the other. You may have to de-power your glider at any 
	moment and this is the only way you can safely do it while attempting a 
	launch. Pulling deep on the brakes does NOT de-power your glider! In 
	addition, you will not have time to go searching for the correct risers if 
	things start to go wrong and you do not have the correct ones in your hands. 
	Jamming the brakes will only make things worse. If you need training on how 
	to do this, we can help.<br></p>
