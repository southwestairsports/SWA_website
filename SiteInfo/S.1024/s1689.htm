	<h1>S.1689 – the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks Wilderness Act</h1>
	<p>2-12-10</p>
	<p>Contacted: Energy and Natural Resources Committee Office 304 Dirksen Senate Building Washington,&nbsp; DC 20510 Phone: (202) 224-4971 Fax: (202) 224-6163</p>
	<p>“I am vice-president of the Rio Grande Soaring Association of Alamogordo, NM.&nbsp; We are a group of sport pilots in southern New Mexico and west Texas who fly hang gliders and paragliders.&nbsp; 
	For years we have launched from Mt Riley and other areas in the Potrillo Mountains.&nbsp; If this area becomes a Federal Wilderness, we will lose both access and flying this beautiful region.&nbsp; 
	WE ARE THE GREENEST OF ALL USERS OF PUBLIC LANDS.&nbsp; We hike up and then fly away = 1/2 the use of any hiker.&nbsp; We do not camp.&nbsp; We make no sound.&nbsp; We do not disturb wildlife.&nbsp; 
	We preserve all ecological and cultural resources.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is the government doing this to us?&nbsp; What harm do we do?&nbsp; We use other protected areas in the southwest, such as 
	Franklin Mountains State Park, El Paso, TX.&nbsp; Please contact me if you would like more information.&nbsp; I would like to attend any hearings you may have.&nbsp; Thank you. Had Robinson 
	915-726-2698”</p>
	<p>Had a nice visit with Sara Tucker of the committee.&nbsp; She suggested I speak with David Brooks 202-224-9863 who is handling the legislation.</p>
	<p>Email to Dara Parker:</p>
	<p>Hi Dara,</p>
	<p>Thank you for taking the time to speak with me this afternoon.</p>
	<p>On behalf of all of the soaring pilots in the southwest, we appreciate it very much.</p>
	<p>So, keeping our current access is essential to paragliding (PG) pilots and critical to hang gliding (HG) pilots.&nbsp; As this is the desert and we have to carry enough water for most of the 
	day, it is already a difficult 40 minute hike for PG pilots to the top from the end of the road/way.</p>
	<p>If a PG pilot has to walk another 1.5 miles, with 300-500’ vertical, and the usual 55 lbs. of gear, it would pretty much eliminate all but the most fit.&nbsp; For HG pilots and approx. 75-100 
	lbs. of gear, it would eliminate them completely.</p>
	<p>I am hoping that the current access can be maintained – access that has been available to the public for many decades or longer.</p>
	<p>A side question of mine would be:&nbsp;&nbsp; What or who is driving the push to designate this area a Federal Wilderness?&nbsp; I’ve been going out there for 30 years and it has not changed 
	from the ground or the air.&nbsp; It is such a remote area and is rarely visited by large numbers of people.&nbsp; Most of the traffic stops at Kilbourne and Hunt’s Holes.&nbsp; What is to be 
	gained that is not already in place?&nbsp;&nbsp; To make the area untouchable generally will benefit who?&nbsp; It’s a real puzzle to me to remove such a vast area from public access – as who will 
	be able to hike through such a place for so many miles that is so hot and dry?&nbsp; Why the push to functionally keep out the public?&nbsp; – as that is what making this a Wilderness will do.&nbsp; 
	The current roads allow the public to visit.&nbsp; If they are taken away, who will go there?&nbsp; Who will be able to enjoy it?</p>
	<p>I am looking forward to seeing you Monday.&nbsp; When you and/or any of your friends, staff, etc. go out to Riley, please let me know and I’ll come along and show you what we do!</p>
	<p>Best wishes,</p>
	<p>Had Robinson, VP Rio Grande Soaring Association Alamogordo, NM</p>
	<p>2/15/10</p>
	<p>John Hummer, of the Greater of Las Cruces Chamber of Commerce, said that group supports wilderness only for the Organ Mountains, but not for other ranges, including the Potrillo Mountains, 
	southwest of Las Cruces</p>
	<p>Sen Bingaman:&nbsp; Bingaman said there's still room for changes to the legislation, the purpose of Monday's hearing.&nbsp; Bingaman's spokeswoman, Jude McCartin, said the next step is to take 
	the testimony into consideration and "determine whether any adjustments should be made." The bill will then go before the Senate Energy Committee.</p>
	<p>2/17/10</p>
	<p>Contacted Jim Bates and will meet with him, God willing, tomorrow.&nbsp; Also need to meet with Nathan Small.&nbsp; Jim had extensive testimony at the hearing 2/15/10.</p>
	<p>Contacted Silvestre Reyes office about this bill.&nbsp; They will keep an eye on it.</p>
	<p>2/26/10</p>
	<p>Met with Robin and Nathan Small in LC to discuss cherry stems.&nbsp; Nathan would like me to propose a different access point to the base of Riley that does not go south of the mtn but from the 
	north.&nbsp; He would also like to know how the prevailing winds work.</p>
	<p>3/3/10&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Called Dara Parker and left message to call concerning:&nbsp; Did any hikers of the Mt. Riley area have any input on how to hike to the top?</p>
	<p>3/4/10 Nice visit with Dara – they are not even sure that PG is allowed in Wilderness Areas?</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
