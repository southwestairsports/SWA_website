		a postage-stamp!</span></p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Lee's Lookout continues to be our best west-facing 
	site for flying in the Franklin Mountains State Park.&nbsp; It is named 
	after local pilot Lee Boone, the discoverer of the site.&nbsp; It is a 
	vertical (12) minute hike from the Transmountain Pass highway (SR #375).&nbsp; 
	As pilots will enter the Park, they must be registered and have paid the 
	daily use fee (or have a Texas State Park pass).&nbsp; Here is the info for registration and passes, go
	<a href="../Agave/registration.htm">here</a>.</p>
	<p>Lee's Lookout should be flown when: 1.) It is too weak to launch from 
	Agave.&nbsp; 2.) Wind direction at Santa Teresa (the National Weather 
	Service location in our region) is west to southwest (PG only).&nbsp; PG 
	pilots should not launch if winds are northwest  –  the site is too small to 
	safely inflate a glider with this wind direction.&nbsp; If winds at the 
	surface are west/southwest and greater than 8-10, launch from Agave is much 
	safer.&nbsp; HG pilots can launch in any direction.&nbsp; Lee's Lookout has 
	the advantage of being just above the daily inversion which reaches about 
	5,000' MSL.&nbsp; It will have sufficient air to launch when Agave is calm.&nbsp; 
	Its proximity to the
	Dragons Mouth (DM) ensures that any west component in the wind will be 
	almost southwest at launch due to the strong vortex at DM which makes launch 
	easier when conditions are weak everywhere else.&nbsp; Launch is tight (10 
	yd. x 10 yd.).&nbsp; If PG pilots walk down the steep slope a ways and lay 
	their wing out near the edge, inflation is easier.&nbsp; The downside is 
	that the pilot cannot see his lines until the glider comes up  –  someone 
	helping can scan them.&nbsp; HG should not have any problems as the launch 
	to north/right has a sheer cliff in front.</p>
	<p>PG pilots should always launch to the left (facing almost south) and 
	follow the ridge out.&nbsp; The stronger the conditions, the more the pilot 
	will ascend immediately after launch.&nbsp; In weaker conditions, he may 
	have to follow the ridge out and hunt for thermals  –  there are always 
	plenty of them!&nbsp; Remember that the geography of Lee's Lookout ensures 
	that winds at launch will be from the south (strong conditions) or southwest 
	(weaker conditions) because of the vortex at DM.&nbsp; That is, if winds at 
	Santa Teresa are west, the winds at launch will be southwest or south.</p>
	<p>The northwest portion of the site can be <em>very thermic</em> due to its dark 
	color and west face, even at the end of the day.&nbsp; But as the pilot is 
	launching to the south (and left), it is safe to launch during a lull as the 
	thermals moving up the northwest part of the site will not affect the air 
	out in front to the left.&nbsp; When winds are west to southwest miles out 
	front, the vortex of the DM causes the air to swirl around the ridge and up 
	the northwest part of the launch area triggering thermals in the process.&nbsp; 
	Accordingly, the air to the south or left will be smooth all the way out if, 
	for example, it is late in the day.&nbsp; Otherwise, thermal strength out 
	front will be the same as elsewhere in the range.&nbsp; The weaker the 
	conditions, the less pronounced this effect is.&nbsp; This has been proven 
	many times by actual flights from the site.</p>
	<h2>IMPORTANT NOTICE</h2>
	<p>Launching from the steep slopes and cliffs in the 
	desert mountains requires good kiting skills.&nbsp; It is hazardous to 
	inflate and then immediately turn before stabilizing your glider overhead 
	for a few seconds or more.&nbsp; Many pilots have damaged their equipment 
	and been banged-up attempting to launch in the often turbulent air that 
	characterizes the air we fly in.&nbsp; Pilots must have the skills to kite a 
	glider overhead under control before attempting a launch, especially in 
	strong air.&nbsp; In addition, all pilots should master inflating their 
	gliders with the A's in one hand and the C's or D's in the other.&nbsp; You 
	may have to de-power your glider at any moment and this is the only way you 
	can safely do it while attempting a launch.&nbsp; Pulling deep on the brakes 
	does NOT de-power your glider!&nbsp; In addition, you will not have time to 
	go searching for the correct risers if things start to go wrong and you do 
	not have the correct ones in your hands.&nbsp; Jamming the brakes will only 
	make things worse.&nbsp; If you need training on how to do this, we can get help</p>
	<h2>LZ Info</h2>
	<p>The main&nbsp; LZ is the area around the Tom Mays Park 
	entrance 2.6 miles NW of launch.&nbsp; Park a vehicle just outside the 
	entrance gate of Tom Mays Park and drive another to the top of the Pass.&nbsp; 
	It is somewhat easier for PG pilots to land on the Tom Mays access road east 
	of the gate as they can set up a mile away.&nbsp; As there are often 
	thermals popping off everywhere around the roads, using the access road east 
	of the gate allows for plenty of margin.&nbsp; The access road slopes down 
	for a half a mile and is clear on both sides.&nbsp; HG pilots should land at 
	the normal LZ for
	<a href="../Agave/agave.htm">Agave Hill</a> which is 6/10ths of a mile NE of the PG LZ.</p>
	<p><img alt="Lee's Lookout" src="GEimage3.jpg" width="1028" height="729"></p>
	<p>Landing in the desert is often more complicated than coastal or other 
	inland sites because of the very hot ground at the surface (+140°F in the 
	summer) which causes small but powerful thermals to pop off near the 
	surface.&nbsp; They can dramatically change where you land.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>The PG LZ near the entrance of Tom Mays Park.&nbsp; The access road faces 
	SW and is a 1/2 mile long so pilots can relax and setup without worry if 
	they encounter thermals while landing.&nbsp; The vehicle in the photo 
	stopped and waited for the pilot to get out of the way.</p>

	<h2>Bail LZ Info</h2>
	<p>If you do a sled ride from launch, just follow the 
	ridge straight out and then make a 90° turn either direction at the end 
	(left for HG/PG or right for PG only).&nbsp; If you go left (south), head 
	for the dirt road that goes from the top of the ridge down the canyon to a 
	housing development.&nbsp; It is plenty long and slopes down at first and 
	then becomes almost level near the housing development.&nbsp; If you go 
	left, remember that it is at least (40) minute drive one way from the pass 
	to pick you up so you must have a driver.&nbsp; To get to the HG/PG bail LZ 
	from the Transmountain highway,&nbsp; go west down the hill for about (5) 
	miles and turn left (south) on N. Resler. j Go 3.4 miles, turn left (east) 
	on High Ridge drive and then go 1.9 miles to the end (at the time of this 
	writing, there is some unimproved road at the end).&nbsp; Make a quick jag 
	right and then left onto Calle Lago for 0.4 miles where there is a gate 
	(it's a gated community).&nbsp; If it's open, you're in luck.&nbsp; If not, 
	you will have to walk up and find your pilot somewhere.</p>
	<p>If conditions at the
	DM are not too strong, PG pilots can fly out to the end of the ridge at 
	launch, turn right (north), and cautiously go in front of the DM at low 
	altitude (&lt;5,000' MSL).&nbsp; Stay well in front of the DM and land on the 
	top of the second finger ridge (past the most northwest of the picnic 
	areas).&nbsp; It is an easy hike from the PG bail LZ to the highway and then 
	to the top of the Pass.&nbsp; The second finger ridge has a road going down 
	it so it is easy to spot.&nbsp; This LZ is nice if the air is dead as it 
	goes downhill the whole way.</p>

	<h2>Site hazards and risk management</h2>
	<p>Launching from this site has two dangers.&nbsp; Be 
	extremely careful of getting sucked into the DM.&nbsp; It is unlikely to 
	happen if you check the wind velocity at the Pass before you hike up.&nbsp; 
	If it's blowing more than 18 at the Pass, be extremely careful when 
	launching – go straight out and keep left of the ridge in front.&nbsp; 
	Better yet, pack up and launch from Agave.&nbsp; If the air at the Pass is 
	less than 18, you are safe no matter where you fly but note that lift 
	disappears at the DM.&nbsp; Landing on the highway is not only illegal but 
	dangerous.</p>
	<p>The second danger is the presence of power lines that go east – west 
	along the side of the canyon to the south of launch.&nbsp; They are almost 
	invisible.&nbsp; Make sure that you get a few hundred over launch before you 
	head south and up.&nbsp; In general – STAY AWAY FROM THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE 
	CANYON NEXT TO LAUNCH UNLESS YOU ARE HIGHER THAN THE RIDGE BEHIND.&nbsp; The 
	power lines, fortunately, turn south after leaving the canyon and the poles 
	are easily visible.&nbsp; Below is an image of a recent flight from Lee's 
	Lookout.&nbsp; The pilot was higher than the ridge behind launch when he 
	flew south. View is looking east.</p>

	Lee's Lookout.&nbsp; You want to smile, too?&nbsp; Fly year 'round in the 
	Franklins with us!&nbsp; From here, this pilot went over 1,000' above the 
	top of the range.</p>
	<p><img alt="Lee's Lookout" src="DSC02886.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>View 1/2 mile above and just south of launch.&nbsp; From here a pilot can 
	fly all the way to the end of the range.&nbsp; HG pilot Dick Moody once flew 
	from here to Ascarate Park many years ago.</p>
	<p><img alt="Lee's Lookout" src="DSC02884.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>The site's rating (H/P3) is due to the following:&nbsp; 
	1.)&nbsp; It is a very tight launch area  –  less than 10 yd. on each side.&nbsp; 
	2.)&nbsp; There is a shear cliff just north of launch (good for HG).&nbsp; 
	3.) You can be blown over the back or sucked into the
	Dragon's Mouth.&nbsp; 4.) There are numerous desert plants in the 
	vicinity of the launch area that can snag the pilot/glider.&nbsp; (It is a 
	safer HG launch than PG.)&nbsp; Despite these hazards, the site is the best 
	we have for flying in the Franklins.&nbsp; Those who successfully launch are 
	virtually guaranteed to get up and out.&nbsp; The
	bailout LZ is easily reachable and safe for both HG and PG.&nbsp; Pilots 
	should not fly this site alone because a minor problem at launch could 
	easily cascade.&nbsp; A helper can assist with layout, the inflation of the 
	glider, look for any potential problems, and help the pilot in the event of 
	a failed launch.&nbsp; Expert pilots regularly fail to launch from this site 
	because of its difficulty.</p>
	<p>Lee Boone (photo below) is standing about where a PG pilot should launch 
	from.&nbsp; When launching, follow the top of the ridge out.&nbsp; At the 
	end there is plenty of lift with thermals galore popping off the power lines 
	at the base of the mountain.&nbsp; (The poles can just be seen near the dirt 
	road.)&nbsp; If you launch at the right time of the cycle, you will get in 
	strong lift right at launch and go straight up.&nbsp; You should always turn 
	left, bench up the ridge behind launch, and get high enough to safely pass 
	over the power lines.&nbsp; Follow the ridge south until you get to S. Mt. 
	Franklin and work your way up via thermals and ridge lift.&nbsp; It's an 
	easy task for most pilots.&nbsp; Then you are in the magic airspace above 
	the range and can fly for hours in any direction.&nbsp; Here is info on 
	safely flying in the 
	<a href="../Agave/agave.htm">Franklins</a> once you are above launch.</p>
	<p>Below is a view looking out from launch to the SW.</p>

	<h2>Pilot Registration</h2>
	<p>You must
	<a href="../Agave/registration.htm">register</a> with the Park before entering or flying.&nbsp; Solo pilots (not recommended) need to notify the 
	Park Police or a Park Ranger before launching.</p>
	<p>Below, Lee Boone soars above the range in the amazing lift that is above 
	the Franklins.&nbsp; Lift is everywhere once you pass 7,000'.&nbsp; This was 
	his first flight from Lee's Lookout and he had no trouble benching up.&nbsp; 
	Pilots can soar the front of these mountains for over 25 miles.</p>
