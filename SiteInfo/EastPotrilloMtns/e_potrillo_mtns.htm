	<h2>Flyable Conditions</h2>
	<p>This is the desert!&nbsp; It is at least an hour of driving and hiking to get to the launch areas so it is a good idea to know the conditions before heading out.&nbsp; Here are the things to 
	check if you want to soar the E. Potrillo Mountains.&nbsp; The range can be flown in thermic conditions, according to your comfort and skill levels but most paragliding instructors do not 
	recommend soaring desert mountain ranges when thermals are strong.</p>
	<blockquote>1. Check the most recent <a href="http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.html">balloon soundings</a> for the region (EPZ) to be sure that the winds are SE to about 8,000' MSL.&nbsp; 
	If there is a strong subsidence inversion above 8,000' MSL, this will help isolate the lower air masses from Jet stream turbulence and other disturbances that may passing through the region.</blockquote>
	<blockquote>Study this sample <a href="2016010400_72364_skewt.gif">Skew-T</a> and <a href="72364%20EPZ-00Z-04-Jan-2016.pdf">text list</a> when conditions were just soarable (Jan 3, 2016).&nbsp; 
	The soundings showed winds SE but this is due to the effects of the Franklin Mountains east of where the NWS balloons are released.&nbsp; Easterly winds moving towards the Franklin Mountains will 
	tend to go through the pass that is SE of the NWS station in Santa Teresa.&nbsp; In other words, balloon soundings below 8,000' MSL (the top of the Franklin Mountains) that have any easterly 
	component will not be accurate per the direction of the air mass about 10 miles east and west of the Franklin Mountain range.&nbsp; As the air mass gets near the Potrillo ranges, its direction 
	will not be influenced by the Franklin Mountains.</blockquote>
	<blockquote>If you do not how to read a balloon sounding, the <a href="../../weather/weather-intro/WeatherIntro.htm">weather section</a> of this site has instructions on how 
		to read balloon soundings, among other things.&nbsp; Our sport is intolerant of pilots who do not take the time to study the weather carefully.</blockquote>
	<blockquote>2. Go to <a href="http://mesowest.utah.edu/cgi-bin/droman/mesomap.cgi?profile_id=PCYq1AS2437JBeS5">MesoWest</a> and check the current conditions at DW8727 Columbus, NM and 7E Deming 
	Airport, NM.&nbsp; If both are NE to E at 7 mph or greater, conditions will be adequate to stay aloft over the spine of the mountains.&nbsp; These two sites are directly north and south of the E. 
	Potrillo range.&nbsp; As the winds turn more SE, the air in the Potrillo range gets more turbulent.</blockquote>

	Access to the Bill Cummings (south) launch requires 4 wheel drive.</p>
	<p>Rated 
	H/P3 or H/P2 with instructor present. This range is (7) miles long and is 
	located in south central New Mexico running SSE to NNW.&nbsp; Because of its 
	orientation and slope, it is well suited for ridge soaring with winds from 
	ESE to NE, especially in weak conditions.&nbsp; In laminar conditions, 
	pilots can stay up in light winds if they stay close to the terrain. 
	However, do not fly close to the terrain if there is any chance of 
	turbulence caused by thermals.&nbsp; In the winter, on cloudy days, or 
	late/early in the day the risk of turbulence is negligible. It is never good 
	to fly when a strong Jet is overhead as gusting in the high desert can be 
	severe and sudden.</p>

	<p>When winds are westerly, soaring might be possible 
	but LZ options are more limited.&nbsp; That is, if you land out somewhere it 
	will be a long hike as there are few access roads on the west side of the 
	range.</p>

	more than 6-7 it should be possible to soar the entire range from end to end 
	but it will take skill navigating a deep saddle in the south end of the 
	range.&nbsp; No one has yet flown the entire length of the range in a single 
	flight.&nbsp; When winds are strong 15+, pilots have to be careful not to 
	get blown over the back.&nbsp; The lift band extends over 1/2 mile out front 
	under these conditions, so it is easy to stay clear of the faster air going 
	over the crest of the mountains.&nbsp; When thermic conditions are present, 
	it should be possible to thermal away to the west and northwest, even

	out from the crest on the west face of these mountains which would make 
	soaring the range with southwest winds difficult because of turbulence.&nbsp; 
	There are no roads running along the west face  –  you will have miles of 
	hiking if you land on this side of the range.</p>

	<h2>Torrey Paso Launch</h2>
	<p>The most accessible launch site is Torrey Paso (see below). Flyable with 
	winds from ESE to NE.&nbsp; When the air is SE, the air tends to be 
	turbulent as it rolls over the fingers out in front.&nbsp; Being just below 
	a saddle in the range, the vortex created by the narrow saddle increases the 
	speed of the air coming in at launch.&nbsp; This makes the site ideal when 
	conditions may be too weak near the surface to get up and out.</p>
	<p>Wind
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_gradient">gradients</a> are 
	significant in the desert southwest because of the rough terrain and greatly 
	affect our ability to launch and stay up.&nbsp; Once up and above the 
	surface of the earth a few hundred feet, we are able to stay aloft.</p>
	<p>It is about 15 minutes to hike to Torrey Paso launch.&nbsp; The actual launch area is at the south end of the saddle and in front where there is a small clearing. When conditions are strong, it 
	may be best to launch from the parking area and bench up.&nbsp; Follow the road from the LZ up the east face, park, and then hike the rest of the way.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;In 
	moderate conditions, the full range is soarable.</p>
	<p>In strong conditions, it might be safer (and less of a hike) to launch from the parking area and bench up.&nbsp; Follow the road from the LZ up the east face, park, and then hike the rest of the way.&nbsp; 
	The lift band is over a 1/2 mile out in front.</p>
	<p>In weak conditions, pilots 
	should turn immediately left (NNW) after launch, stay close to the terrain, 
	and stay in The Bowl (the lift band which goes about 1/2 mile NNE).&nbsp; If 
	you go further, you will quickly sink out.</p>
	<p>The LZ is 
	huge and unobstructed.&nbsp; However, skilled pilots can land on the road to the 
	parking area to save a 1/4 mile hike.&nbsp; Near the end of the day (an hour 
	before sunset), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katabatic_wind">
	katabatic flow</a>  out of the mountains (like everywhere else in the 
	southwest) is significant.&nbsp; Winds aloft and near 
	the surface can be 180 degrees different so be ready to land 
	going downwind.&nbsp; This means landing flares must be very deep and you 
	may have to run it out.&nbsp; Fortunately, the main LZ is fairly flat and, if 
	you have a wind sock planted, you should be able to land into the wind without 
	going uphill.</p>

	<p>Lee Boone (below) setting up at 
	Torrey Paso launch.&nbsp; The launch is not sheer in front so pilots can 
	safely abort a run.&nbsp; This is the desert and bushes that can snag lines 
	are everywhere.&nbsp; Be sure to take the time to lay your lines out 
	carefully as a snag will flip your glider into more bushes and you will 
	spend an hour getting everything out....</p>

	<h2>BENCH SITE</h2>
	<p> Theebench site is above the parking area near and below Torrey Paso launch.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	With strong east winds, this area should provide good benching possibilities for both HG and 
	PG.&nbsp; It is on a spine right at the base of the bowl.With strong east winds, this area should provide good benching possibilities for both HG and

	<h2>BILL CUMMINGS LAUNCH</h2>
	<p>400' AGL&nbsp; This launch site tends to have smoother 
	air when it is coming from the SE but is flyable with easterly through north 
	easterly winds.&nbsp; It is the only site that faces true east (which is way 
	it works better for SE winds).&nbsp; It is accessible by 4 wheel drive and 
	is more suitable for hang gliders as it has a steeper slope than the Bench 
	Site above the Torrey Paso LZ.&nbsp; Winds may be stronger overall at the 
	South launch as well.&nbsp; Launching in westerly winds might be possible 
	but is not recommended.&nbsp; Here are the
	<a href="Directions/directions_south_launch.htm">directions to the launch site</a>.</p>
	<p>Below is the view from launch looking east.&nbsp; The Franklin 
	Mountains are visible in the far distance.&nbsp; The launch slopes down 
	about 45 degrees to the flats.</p>

	<p>Our thanks to Bill Cummings and David 
	Grant for their assistance and advice in improving this site.</p>
	<h2>IMPORTANT NOTICE</h2>
	<p>Launching from the steep 
	slopes and cliffs in the desert mountains requires excellent kiting skills.&nbsp; 
	It is hazardous to inflate and then immediately turn before stabilizing your 
	glider overhead for a few seconds or more.&nbsp; Many pilots have damaged 
	their equipment and been banged-up attempting to launch in the often 
	turbulent air that characterizes the desert air we fly in.&nbsp; Pilots must have 
	the skills to kite a glider overhead under control before attempting a 
	launch, especially in strong air.&nbsp; In addition, all pilots should 
	master inflating their gliders with the A's in one hand and the C's or D's 
	in the other.&nbsp; You may have to de-power your glider at any moment and 
	this is the only way you can safely do it while attempting a launch.&nbsp; 
	Pulling deep on the brakes does NOT de-power your glider!&nbsp; In addition, 
	you will not have time to go searching for the correct risers if things 
	start to go wrong and you do not have the correct ones in your hands.&nbsp; 
	Jamming the brakes will only make things worse.&nbsp; If you need training 
	on how to do this, we can help.</p>
