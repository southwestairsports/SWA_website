	<h1>Magdalena Rim </h1>
		<p>Doña Ana County, New Mexico</p>
	<p>Please contact the
		<a href="http://www.rgsa.info">RGSA</a> or
		<a href="../../ContactUs/contactus.htm">Southwest Airsports</a> if you 
		would like to fly this site.</p>
	<h2>General</h2>
	<p>Magdalena Rim is the 
		most friendly site in the southwest for paragliding and hang gliding.&nbsp; 
		In moderate winds it is easy to get 600' over launch.&nbsp; The rim 
		faces southwest for much of its length and then faces south and then SSE at the most southerly end.&nbsp; The best lift is 
	near the southeast end at its highest elevation.</p>
	<p>When is it best to fly the Rim?&nbsp; South or SSW winds &gt; 7 mph at launch (PG) are the minimum for soaring.&nbsp; We have flown the site with winds in the high teens without problems.&nbsp; 
	Westerly winds will make the air turbulent along the Rim because of the small mountain chain west of launch.&nbsp; Here are some balloon soundings from the Santa Teresa, NM National Weather 
	Service station that can help pilots know when the site is soarable: <a href="balloon_sounding_72364_epz_santa_1.htm">minimum conditions #1</a>&nbsp;
	<a href="balloon_sounding_72364_epz_santa_2.htm">minimum conditions #2</a>&nbsp; <a href="balloon_sounding_72364_epz_santa_3.htm">maximum conditions</a>.&nbsp; The site has its own winds even when 
	regional pressure gradients are weak or non-existent.&nbsp; The movement into the region of upper level disturbances can greatly affect the winds at launch and things may be blown out or dead.</p>
	<p>Thermals from the plains in front will come rolling in most of the day and can be very strong.&nbsp; They start tapering off about 2 hours before dusk and, except for glass-offs, disappear 1 
	hour before dusk.&nbsp; Generally, it is not a good idea (PG) to mix ridge soaring with thermalling.&nbsp; The inversion at the Rim is deep in the morning and the site becomes windy quickly.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>It is a premier ridge soaring (PG &amp; HG) and thermalling (HG) site:</p>
	<blockquote>1. Launch is easily accessible by paved road almost the entire way.&nbsp; 
	4 wheel drive is unnecessary.&nbsp; The main LZ is just a 12 minute trip 
	from the top of the rim.</blockquote>
	<blockquote>2. It is our safest site for newer pilots (HG/PG) 
	because the sides and rear of launch are clear for hundreds of yards.&nbsp; 
	The launch face is not a precipice so <a href="http://youtu.be/wfCK5GyK7D8">
	side-hill landings for PG</a> are easy to do.&nbsp; Blown launches (PG) are 
	more forgiving due to the absence of barbed wire fences, trees, buildings, 
	huge rocks, cliffs, etc.&nbsp; Bailout LZ's are abundant and easy to land 
		in.&nbsp; Retrieve is possible via a jeep trail out in front of the rim but 
		it takes an hour to get there.</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p>3. 
	The topography behind launch allows top-landings without having to deal with 
	hazardous rotor/turbulence that is present at all our other sites with the 
	exception of Kilbourne Hole maar.&nbsp; The top landing area is enormous 
	which means pilots can make significant errors in setup and not be exposed 
	to hazards.&nbsp; It is the only site other than Kilbourne where PG pilots 
	can inflate their glider, move slowly and with control to the launch edge, 
	and be gently lifted up.</p>
		<p>4.&nbsp;Easy access, a clear launch area, and the 
	ability to consistently top-land makes Magdalena Rim ideal for tandems and flights by the handicapped.</p>
		<p>5.&nbsp;It is flyable with winds 
	from southeast to west.</p>
		<p>6.&nbsp;When 
	thermals are present, the site can be flown in light winds.&nbsp; The 
	thermals drift in at Middle Launch with a southwest breeze.&nbsp; 
	Pilots should focus on staying in the thermals rather than fly up and down 
	the ridge.&nbsp; The wide open 
	range presents few hazards to flying away from launch.&nbsp; An abundance of 
	roads in the region makes retrieves easy.</p>
		<p>7.&nbsp;Camping can be done in 
	the area.</p>

	<h2>Directions to Launch</h2>
	<p>Please <a href="../../ContactUs/contactus.htm">contact us</a> or the
	<a href="http://www.rgsa.info">RGSA</a> if you would like to fly this site.</p>
	<h2>Launch Areas</h2>
	<p>Middle launch is best in most conditions.&nbsp; The more gentle slope in 
	front disturbs the air less coming in at launch.&nbsp; Paragliders should 
	use this launch.</p>
	<p>South launch 
	is about 100' higher than 
	middle launch. It may be used when conditions are light.&nbsp; When winds 
	are more than 10, it is too turbulent, especially for paragliders.</p>
	<p>On the way up to the Rim, pilots will pass the LZ at the east base of the 
	Rim 
	on the left side of the road.&nbsp; Be sure to put a wind sock in the LZ as 
	you pass by, in case you need it.&nbsp; Take the jeep trail to the fence 
	near the edge of 
	the rim.&nbsp; Please stay on the roads at all times.&nbsp; Close any gates 
	you go through  –  the ranchers will greatly appreciate it.&nbsp; Never 
	disturb livestock, clean up trash that you find, leave the area better than 
	when you came.&nbsp; Please help preserve our valuable and fragile desert.</p>
	<h2>Landing Zones</h2>
	<p>Pilots can do easy top landings the entire length of the Rim.&nbsp; Approximately 450 yards northwest of Middle Launch is a small canyon.&nbsp; The canyon acts as a vortex and the winds in and 
	near it can be high and turbulent.&nbsp; Therefore, it is recommended that pilots stay southeast of the fence that borders this canyon.&nbsp; There is virtually no rotor or turbulence behind the 
	rim.&nbsp; However, if pilots land late in the day, they will pass through the forming inversion and experience some minor turbulence.&nbsp; We keep exploring the area behind launch to see how 
	deep we can safely go before it drops off into the canyon where the access road is.</p>
	<p>The main LZ is not visible from launch but is  
	reachable on glide.&nbsp; Bailout LZ's are abundant in front of launch.&nbsp; 
	Because of the presence of boulders, stay out of the 30' deep arroyo that runs NW to SE along the front of the 
	rim.</p>
	<h2>Hazards</h2>
	<p>Pilots must take care not to land in the arroyo that is 
	about 200 yd. out from the base of the rim.&nbsp; The arroyo is about 200' 
	wide.&nbsp; Beyond the arroyo is a flat plain that is accessible by jeep 
	trail.&nbsp; Just east of the main LZ is a power line that runs along the 
	east side of the road.&nbsp; Cell service is fairly good in the area.&nbsp; 
	Amateur radio operators will find the NM <a href="../../faqs-tips/nm5ml-map.jpg">
	Mega-Link</a> Las Cruces (147.18 MHz 100Hz tone) and the Caballo (147.26 MHz 
	100 Hz. tone) repeaters accessible.&nbsp; The 147.16 MHz 162.2Hz tone WTRA repeater in El Paso also works very well in the area.</p>

	<p>View just below Middle Launch.&nbsp; In the far distance to the right are

	<p>Denae Nemanic, the first woman to fly Magdalena Rim prepares to launch.&nbsp;

	aloft are S to SW.</p>
