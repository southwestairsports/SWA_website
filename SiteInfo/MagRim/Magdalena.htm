		would like to fly this site.</p>
	<h2>General</h2>
	<p>Magdalena Rim is a friendly site for paragliding and hang gliding.&nbsp; 
		In moderate winds it is easy to get 600' over launch.&nbsp; The rim 
		faces southwest for much of its length and then it starts 
		to turn south and then SSE at the southerly end.&nbsp; The best lift is 
	near the southeast end at its highest elevation.</p>
	<p>It is an excellent ridge soaring and thermalling site for the following 
	reasons:</p>
	<blockquote>1. Launch is easily accessible by paved road almost the entire way.&nbsp; 
	4 wheel drive is unnecessary.&nbsp; The main LZ is just a 12 minute trip 
	from the top of the rim.</blockquote>
	<blockquote>2. It is our safest site for newer pilots (HG/PG) 
	because the sides and rear of launch are clear for hundreds of yards.&nbsp; 
	The launch face is not a precipice so <a href="http://youtu.be/wfCK5GyK7D8">
	side-hill landings for PG</a> are easy to do.&nbsp; Blown launches (PG) are 
	more forgiving due to the absence of barbed wire fences, trees, buildings, 
	huge rocks, cliffs, etc.&nbsp; Bailout LZ's are abundant and easy to land 
		in.&nbsp; Retrieve is possible via a jeep trail out in front of the rim but 
		it takes an hour to get there.</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p>3. 
	The topography behind launch allows top-landings without having to deal with 
	hazardous rotor/turbulence that is present at all our other sites with the 
	exception of Kilbourne Hole maar.&nbsp; The top landing area is enormous 
	which means pilots can make significant errors in setup and not be exposed 
	to hazards.&nbsp; It is the only site other than Kilbourne where PG pilots 
	can inflate their glider, move slowly and with control to the launch edge, 
	and be gently lifted up.</p>
		<p>4.&nbsp; Easy access, a clear launch area, and the 
	ability to consistently top-land makes Magdalena Rim ideal for tandem and 
	flights by the handicapped.&nbsp; We are looking forward to making this 
	available to special needs pilots.</p>
		<p>5.&nbsp; It is flyable with winds 
	from southeast to west.</p>
		<p>6.&nbsp; When 
	thermals are present, the site can be flown in light winds.&nbsp; The 
	thermals drift in nicely at Middle Launch with a southwest breeze.&nbsp; 
	Pilots should focus on staying in the thermals rather than fly up and down 
	the ridge.&nbsp; Jumping to the higher rim 0.6 miles behind has been done by 
	hang glider pilots but not yet by paragliding pilots.&nbsp; The wide open 
	range presents few hazards to flying away from launch.&nbsp; An abundance of 
	roads in the region makes retrieves easy.</p>
		<p>7.&nbsp; Camping can be done in 
	the area.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<h2>When to fly</h2>
	<p>When is the best to fly the Rim?&nbsp; South or SSW winds (180-220) will give the 
	best air for soaring.&nbsp; There is no weather station nearby that can give us real-time data on wind speed and direction so we must rely on other sources of information.&nbsp; The Deming and Las 
	Cruces airports are minimal help in indicating what we will experience at Middle Launch.</p>
	<p>This means that pilots must know how to check the latest balloon soundings at <a href="http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.html">Santa Teresa (EPZ)</a>.&nbsp; (For a brief introduction on 
	balloon soundings, go to our page on <a href="../../weather/tools-info/ToolInfo.htm">weather explanations</a>.)&nbsp; Look at the DRCT and SKNOT columns which give the direction and wind speed at 
	a particular altitude (HGHT column), respectively.&nbsp; If there is any wind direction greater than 240 degrees up to at least 12,000' MSL (4,800m MSL), the conditions at Mag may be poor.&nbsp; 
	The less the westerly component in the wind direction as altitude increases, the less turbulence.</p>
	<p>Here is a sample
	<a href="balloon_sounding_72364_epz_santa_1.htm">balloon sounding</a> from Santa Teresa, NM that shows ideal winds aloft.</p>
	<p>The problem with the latest balloon sounding is that it may be up to (12) hours old.&nbsp; This means that it is important to know how to study the OP40 forecast from the National Weather 
	Service.&nbsp; To learn how to use this important forecast, go to <a href="../../weather/tools-info/ToolInfo.htm">weather explanations</a> and page down to the "OP40 any location" paragraph.&nbsp; 
	The Mag Rim coordinates are 32.478792, -107.119341.&nbsp; You may to reduce the "number of hours" setting to get things to load.&nbsp; A good value to use is the minimum time necessary to see the 
	forecast when you are planning to fly there.&nbsp; The forecast is a forecast and can be off per when winds switch directions.&nbsp; Always keep this in mind!</p>
	<p>If you have a subscription to <a href="http://www.xcskies.com/">XC Skies</a>, it should also be checked.&nbsp; Only fly Mag if all forecasts agree unless you want to waste your time.&nbsp; We 
	are continually amazed that if just one forecast shows some radical departure from the others, it is usually the one that is the most accurate.</p>
	<p>Wind speeds need to be at least 6 mph on the forecasts at the surface to make Mag soarable.&nbsp; The wind speed at Middle Launch will always be more than the forecast.&nbsp; The maximum wind 
	speed forecast should be less than (15) if you are in a paraglider.</p>
	<h2>Directions to Launch</h2>
	<p>The two launch areas are easily accessible 
	from County Highway C009 (Corralitos Road) at I-10 (32.265645° 
	-106.982003°).&nbsp; If coming from the east take I-10 Exit 132, if from the 
	west, take Exit 127 and get on the north access road.&nbsp; Follow the 
	pavement for about 20 miles until you see the jeep trail just before some 
	power poles on the southwest side of the road (32.490376° -107.138142°).&nbsp; 
	Park at the fence.&nbsp; It is an 8 minute walk to Middle Launch.</p>
	<h2>Launch Areas</h2>
	<p>Middle launch is best in most conditions.&nbsp; The more gentle slope in 
	front disturbs the air less coming in at launch.&nbsp; Paragliders should 
	use this launch.</p>
	<p>South launch 
	is about 100' higher than 
	middle launch. It may be used when conditions are light.&nbsp; When winds 
	are more than 10, it is too turbulent, especially for paragliders.</p>
	<p>On the way up to the Rim, pilots will pass the LZ at the east base of the 
	Rim 
	on the left side of the road.&nbsp; Be sure to put a wind sock in the LZ as 
	you pass by, in case you need it.&nbsp; Take the jeep trail to the fence 
	near the edge of 
	the rim.&nbsp; Please stay on the roads at all times.&nbsp; Close any gates 
	you go through  –  the ranchers will greatly appreciate it.&nbsp; Never 
	disturb livestock, clean up trash that you find, leave the area better than 
	when you came.&nbsp; Please help preserve our valuable and fragile desert.</p>
	<h2>Landing Zones</h2>
	<p>Pilots can do easy top landings the entire length of the Rim.&nbsp; The main LZ is not visible from launch but is  
	reachable on glide.&nbsp; Bailout LZ's are abundant in front of launch.&nbsp; 
	Stay out of the 30' deep arroyo that runs NW to SE along the front of the 
	rim.</p>
	<h2>Hazards</h2>
	<p>Pilots must take care not to land in the arroyo that is 
	about 200 yd. out from the base of the rim.&nbsp; The arroyo is about 200' 
	wide.&nbsp; Beyond the arroyo is a flat plain that is accessible by jeep 
	trail.&nbsp; Just east of the main LZ is a power line that runs along the 
	east side of the road.&nbsp; Cell service is sketchy in the area.&nbsp; 
	Amateur radio operators will find the NM <a href="../../faqs-tips/nm5ml-map.jpg">
	Mega-Link</a> Las Cruces (147.18 MHz 100Hz tone) and the Caballo (147.26 MHz 
	100 Hz. tone) repeaters accessible.</p>
