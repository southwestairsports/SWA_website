		or H/P2 with an instructor present.&nbsp; This is primarily a thermic site.&nbsp; There is little ridge lift at launch so pilots must nail the house thermal to get high enough to enter winds 
		aloft where there is some ridge lift mixed with thermals.&nbsp; It is flyable with winds from 220° to 320°.&nbsp; 
	Best winds are winds from 240° - 260° at 8 - 12 mph for PG.&nbsp; When winds are less than 240°, ridge lift is much less and there is a lot turbulence at launch from the base of N Mt. Franklin.&nbsp; When winds go north of 260°, the site becomes turbulent because of the small mountains in front. &nbsp;Conditions fade an hour 
	before sunset and you will not likely be able to bench up.&nbsp; If conditions are weak or it is late in the day, go to
	<a href="../LeesLookout/LeesLookout.htm">Lee's Lookout</a> instead.</p>
	<p>We suggest that visiting pilots fly the site with a guide 
	because of potential hazards soaring the Franklin Mountains.&nbsp; Contact

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>The Franklin Mountains present exciting 
	and challenging flying, especially for ridge and thermal soaring.&nbsp; Because of direct 
	exposure to the west and with no other mountain ranges out front, the range 
	has excellent soaring.&nbsp; On average days, an intermediate pilot can 
	soar over 1,500' higher than the highest peak.</p>

	<p>Significant skill is required to successfully fly Agave because of the transition from thermal lift to a combination of thermal and ridge lift.&nbsp; You will 
	perfect your benching abilities as getting up and out is not easily done 
	(see below for notes on how to do it).&nbsp; The shopping centers, parking 
	lots, and industrial buildings west of the Park are a constant source of 
	thermals that drift into the mountains.&nbsp; These thermals, combined with 
	ridge lift, make this the amazing site that it is.&nbsp; Make sure you have 
	a GPS  –  you must always know your speed over the ground.&nbsp; At slow 
	speeds you may be going forward or backward  –  make sure you know which.&nbsp; 
	Altitude at launch is about the top of the daily inversion which covers the Rio Grande 
	valley and can make the air at launch variable.&nbsp; Pilots need to time 
	their launch carefully at the beginning of the cycle in order to get up and 
	out.&nbsp; If there is enough wind velocity to ridge soar at launch, it means that winds above launch are dangerous and pilots may be blown back into Mundys Gap.</p>

	<p>Gusting forecasts &amp; Jet Stream Info: It is important to note that 
	overhead disturbances, thermal activity, and the Jet stream can greatly 
	affect our flying in the Franklin mountains.&nbsp; Thermals and atmospheric disturbances 
	can cause the Jet to mix down to the surface and cause dangerous sheer 
	turbulence.&nbsp; If you see any gusting in the

	<h2>Launch</h2>
	<p>If the winds are 240° there is some turbulence at the 
	launch face caused by the Triangle 
	and the canyons in front but it is benign. There are no cliffs or major 
	obstacles either in front or behind launch which means it's easy to bail in 
	case you need to.&nbsp; The 
	area in front of launch has enough lift to get you to the house thermal north of launch if the winds are coming in over 6 
	mph.&nbsp; Once in the house thermal, pilots can get up and out.</p>
	<p>Stay away from the vortex at Mundy's Gap (the saddle northeast and behind launch).&nbsp; Do not fly behind launch unless you are certain the winds aloft (6K' MSL) are 
	less than 15 ( for PG).&nbsp; Top landing at Agave is possible.&nbsp; Be 
	patient getting up and out.&nbsp; You must utilize the house thermal that is about 100m north of launch unless the winds are over 12+.&nbsp; 
	In that case, you will need to worry about being blown over the back from 
	the higher winds aloft.&nbsp; Our advice is: stay on the ground.</p>
	<h2 id="Benching_up_from_The_Triangle_">Benching up from The Triangle</h2>
	<p>With a minimum of 100' (300' is best) 
	over launch, it is possible to fly south over Deep Sink Canyon and get to 
	The Triangle where there is weal ridge lift.&nbsp; If you are patient and stay in this weak lift, the normal thermic cycles will create a thermal here that will allow you to go right to the top 
	of the mountains (see the image below).</p>
	<p>The Triangle works with air 
	the same way water runs down your arm and off your elbow.&nbsp; There are 
	many ridges that go up from the base and connect at the top and so on.&nbsp; 
	Thermals follow these ridges up and can merge at the top.&nbsp; The very top 
	of the Triangle has a sum of all the thermals going up the ridges.&nbsp; 
	Thermals here have a period of about 5 minutes so you must be patient once you 
	are aloft.&nbsp; Wind velocity periods are about 2+ minutes.</p>
	<p>If you 
	don't have the necessary height over launch, do not attempt to cross Deep Sink Canyon but continue to work the house thermal or head for the LZ.&nbsp; If the 
	winds are not northwest, you can head for the road leading to the parking 
	area from which you hiked.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Triangle is bisected by two 
	smaller triangles at the bottom.&nbsp; If you are near or above the top of 
	the smaller triangle to the north, you will be at a sufficient altitude to 
	bench up.&nbsp; In other words, if you are above launch and can look 
	straight across to the top of this smaller triangle, head across Deep Sink 
	Canyon.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may have to soar the Triangle a while as you wait 
	for a thermal to blow in from the valley.&nbsp; If winds are weak, be 
	patient!&nbsp; If you do not know how to turn flat and conditions are weak, 
	you will probably sink out.&nbsp; Who said this site is easy?&nbsp; However, if you bench up (like at Point of the Mountain), treasures await!</p>

	<p>
	<img alt="paraglider at Agave Hill" src="IMG_4805.JPG" width="1024" height="684"></p>
	<p>Watch your forward speed at all times when getting high at the Triangle.&nbsp; 
	If you think you are being blown backwards, apply full speed bar immediately 
	and head straight out or south into the sinky area directly in front of N. 
	Mount Franklin (between the ridges).&nbsp; You may have to juggle this 
	maneuver with big ears.&nbsp; The
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_gradient">gradients</a> in the 
	Franklins are substantial and going out and down will quickly get you out of 
	the fast air.&nbsp; Lift is everywhere upwind of the range and you will find 
	it a mile or more out in front 1+ hours either side of sunrise/sunset.&nbsp; 
	It is not advisable to fly PG in the summer between 10:30AM and 6:30PM  –  
	the thermals are very strong and turbulence near the terrain can be 
	unnerving.&nbsp; Launching in the late afternoon pretty much guarantees a 
	smooth ride to the top but be sure to launch at least an hour before sunset.&nbsp; 
	Stay within The Triangle as much as possible as there is bad sink/rotor in 
	the canyons on either side.&nbsp; Once you are a few hundred feet above the 
	top of The Triangle, you can drift back towards N. Mt. Franklin.&nbsp; If 
	you find yourself going down, head back to The Triangle and try 
	again.&nbsp;Be patient.</p>

	<h2>Winds Aloft</h2>
      <p>Check winds aloft before arriving at launch.&nbsp; 
	If it's over 20 mph at 9K', do not fly (PG) as you can get blown over the 
	top of the range which would be an adventure.&nbsp; The presence of the
	Triangle to the south of launch and the 
	vortex at Mundy's Gap to the northeast always affect the winds at launch.&nbsp; 
	Winds will always tend to be southwesterly regardless of whether winds aloft 
	are much more west and even northwest.&nbsp; This is why it is important to have a visible windsock on the Park entrance road.</p>
	<p>If winds aloft are too 
	southerly (less than 240°) you will notice more turbulence at launch, no lift out front, quirky air, and, especially, the presence of sink out in front.&nbsp; Nonetheless, none of these conditions 
	  are particularly hazardous = sled ride to the bottom but you may not reach the LZ.&nbsp; Landing somewhere out front means a hike to the road and, perhaps, picking your glider out of the bushes.&nbsp; 
	  Stay out of the arroyos because of rotor/turbulence when landing short.&nbsp; Pilots have landed everywhere out front and have not experienced any particularly hazardous conditions.&nbsp; Stay 
	  to the south of launch as much as possible if you have to land short.&nbsp; It will be a pleasant and easy sled ride. More experienced pilots can land in the parking lot at the base of the trail 
	  going up to Agave and thus save themselves a long hike back to their vehicles.</p>
	<p>Remember:&nbsp;This is the desert and air during mid day, especially 
	during the summer months, can be challenging.&nbsp; Less experienced pilots 
	should stick to the early AM or late PM outside the late fall and winter 
	months.&nbsp; Laminar air is almost always present late in the day and 
	dreamboat soaring in the Franklins occurs at that time.&nbsp; Thermals can 
	be gigantic and sharp-edged here, as in the Owens Valley.&nbsp; Always check 
	the weather or with us before flying.</p>
	<h2>LZ</h2>
	<p>The Park authorities have graciously permitted us to land on 
	Park roads.&nbsp; A sled ride from launch will provide adequate altitude to 
	land just beyond (SE of) the check-in cabana or, better, to land on the road 
	just southwest of the parking area at the base of the trail that goes to 
	Agave Hill.&nbsp; That way, you can hike back up to launch if you failed to 
	bench up the first time.&nbsp; It is advisable to put up a streamer on the 
	side of the road as wind direction can change often.</p>
	<p>If you land near 
	sunset, be cautious of the
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katabatic_wind">katabatic</a> flow that comes down the mountains.&nbsp; It can be just 20' thick going west and the air just above it can be moving east = do 
	NOT land near the mountains if it is late in the day but land on a high spot out in front of the Park.&nbsp; While pilots can land safely anywhere in the flats in an emergency, it is best to stick 
	to established roads, cleared areas, and trails.&nbsp; Be sure to personally check out the LZ's before using them.</p>
	<h2>Going over the Back</h2>
	<p>If you go over the back of the range, head northeast or you will fly into the controlled airspace ("C") of El Paso International Airport that begins at the north/south Patriot Freeway (Hwy 54).&nbsp; 
	The moment you sense you are going backwards, get as high in lift as you can and then once you start descending again (after you are downwind of the range), turn tail with full speed bar away from 
	the mountains.&nbsp; If you can, stay out of the controlled airspace.&nbsp; Land anywhere safe as far away as possible from the mountains.&nbsp; Your ground crew or other pilots will call the 
	airport if you must land in controlled airspace and notify them of the emergency so don't worry about that – just land safely.&nbsp; However, this event will never occur if you check winds aloft 
	BEFORE flying!</p>
	<h2>Dragon's Mouth</h2>
	<p>The Dragon's Mouth (DM) greatly affects the winds 
	and lift in this part of the Franklins.&nbsp; When getting near or crossing 
	Transmountain gap (State Hwy #375) from the south, it is important to be at 
	7,000' MSL or above as there is no lift and, if winds are &gt;12 out in front, 
	there is a risk of being sucked into the Pass  –  it is powerful vortex.&nbsp; When 
	approaching the Pass from the north, the pilot will already be at 7,000' or 
	above and there will be a slight tailwind so crossing the gap is much faster 
	(and safer) than coming from the south.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Please see image 
	below.)</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Dragons Mouth - Franklin Mountains State Park" src="GoogleEarthDragon'sMouth.jpg" width="1028" height="729"></p>
	<p>Coming north is usually harder.&nbsp; In the image above and below there 
	is a little hill just to the upper left of the red circle called Secret 
	Hill.&nbsp; If you are coming from the south, you want to be sure your 
	starting altitude is at least 7,000' and then crab north directly over the 
	ridge.&nbsp; If you can get to Secret Hill and be level with it, you are 
	home free.&nbsp; Then, just follow the ridge right back up to the top of N. 
	Mt. Franklin.&nbsp; The lift is superb north and above Secret Hill because 
	it works much like the Triangle  –  thermals wick up the ridges and pop off 
	the top of this hill.&nbsp; Always watch your ground speed carefully!&nbsp; 
	Come down immediately and land anywhere if you start going backwards.&nbsp; 
	Unlike flying through gradients, you will not easily know that your airspeed 
	over the ground is decreasing.&nbsp; The change starts slowly and then 
	increases rapidly as you get near DM.&nbsp; Mundy's Gap should also be 
	avoided but is nothing like the Pass at Transmountain.&nbsp; Make sure your 
	speed bar is attached and working properly before launching.&nbsp; This is 
	the most hazardous area of the Franklins but is easily avoided.</p>
	<p>Below is the view a pilot should have before crossing Transmountain.&nbsp; 
	He is well above the peak of N. Mt. Franklin (&gt;7,200').&nbsp; You will lose 
	over 1K' crossing the gap.&nbsp; Stay west of the ridge by crabbing as you 
	go north.&nbsp; As long as you can stay west of the ridge and move north, 
	you will cross the gap.&nbsp; However, if you stop moving north it means 
	that the wind velocity at the gap is the same as your forward speed!&nbsp; 
	You can use some speed bar to continue but be careful.&nbsp; If you do not 
	think you can reach Secret Hill, turn south immediately and land at the 
	country club (easily visible with its fairways and greens).&nbsp; The DM is 
	a giant sucking machine and gets worse the lower and east you go.</p>
	<p>If you get sucked into the DM, don't panic  –  turn east, hit the speed 
	bar, and stay as high as you can.&nbsp; Follow the strong air out of the 
	mountains which means follow the highway.&nbsp; It will be an adventure but 
	probably harmless.&nbsp; Sometime, we will launch an RC model airplane or a 
	helium balloon and watch it go through the DM and let the world know what 
	happens.</p>

	<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
	<p>It is possible to explore the canyons and ridges of the Franklin Mountains.&nbsp; You can top land on some of the ridges and local pilots have set up for landing on them a number of times.&nbsp; 
	The only reason we can think of for doing this is if you must land quickly for some reason, like avoiding the Dragon's Mouth.&nbsp; You will probably have to hike out as the bushes make wing 
	inflation difficult.</p>
	<p>You will not 
	enjoy flying the Franklins if winds aloft are faster than your glider's top 
	speed.&nbsp; Katabatic flow down the mountains begins at dusk and makes 
	landing more difficult as the pilot will be landing in a weak downwind = 
	higher ground speed with the possibility of air just above going the 
	opposite direction.&nbsp; Be READY for this if you plan to fly late.&nbsp; 
	This daily flow is often strong enough to overcome the prevailing wind.&nbsp; 
	This means that the pilot will find himself flying in air going the opposite 
	direction as he descends below about 300' AGL.&nbsp; Above this altitude, 
	the winds may still be strong enough to keep the pilot in ridge lift.&nbsp; 
	When it doubt, fly to, and then land on a ridge a mile or two west of the 
	mountains as the katabatic flow will be much weaker there.</p>
