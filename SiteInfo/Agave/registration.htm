	<h1>Pilot Registration for Flying in Franklin Mountains State Park</h1>
	<p>Pilots must fly in a safe manner, protect the safety of other visitors, 
	and preserve the Park's cultural and ecological resources.&nbsp; For 
	questions/info call Franklin Mountains State Park at 915-566-6441.</p>
	<p>We recommend that pilots flying alone notify the Park 
	Police at (915) 319-0589.&nbsp; Tell them when you expect to launch and land.&nbsp; If case you have trouble, they can help.</p>
	<p>If there is an accident contact the Park Police at (915) 319-0589.&nbsp; If you cannot reach them, dial 911.&nbsp; It is always better to contact the Park Police because they know the Park 
	better than anyone.</p>
	<p>If you are flying at Agave Hill, pilots should ask for the gate combo 
	when checking in or they may be locked in if they land after the Park closes.</p>
	<p>1.&nbsp; Register with the Park authorities before flying in the Park 
		and every year thereafter.&nbsp; Print out the <a href="Permit.pdf">permit application</a> using Adobe Reader.&nbsp; 
		Please initial next to each bullet.&nbsp; Before you arrive, complete 
		the permit application and make copies of these (3) items:</p>
	<blockquote>a.) USHPA membership with a H/P3 rating or greater.&nbsp; If a 
	pilot is from outside the U.S., 
	Southwest Airsports can supply a temporary (30) day USPHA membership for $10.&nbsp; If you are with an USHPA instructor, you can have an H/P2 rating.&nbsp; 
	<a href="../../ContactUs/contactus.htm">Contact us</a> if you need help.</blockquote>
	<blockquote>b.) Proof of medical insurance – Pilots are not permitted to fly 
	in the Park unless they have medical insurance.&nbsp; We have lost 
	many sites in the U.S. because of injuries sustained by uninsured pilots 
	who must have their medical expenses paid for by taxpayers.</blockquote>
	<blockquote>c.) Driver's license</blockquote>
	<p>You can email/mail/fax the permit application and copies of the required 
	documents to <a href="FMSPContacts.htm">Park Headquarters</a>.&nbsp; To email the application, please scan the required documents and email them to: <a href="mailto:erika.rubio@tpwd.state.tx.us">
	erika.rubio@tpwd.state.tx.us</a>&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Pilots may also deliver the application and copies to a Park Police 
	Officer or the Ranger on duty at 
	the Tom Mays Unit.&nbsp; If you cannot find a Ranger or the Police, it is 
	temporary  –  please wait or call the Park police or HQ.&nbsp; If you are with 
	Southwest Airsports or the Rio Grande Soaring Association, Had Robinson or 
	one of the club officers can take your registration material when you arrive 
	at the Park and deliver it the Park office.</p>
	<p>Pilots who do not meet the minimum rating requirement must have an USHPA instructor 
	present. We 
	recommend that you have the CL (cliff launch) &amp; TUR (turbulence) ratings.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp; Pay a use fee to enter the Park ($5/person/day as of 2015).</p>
	<p>As of 2015 the cost of annual Texas State Park pass is $70.&nbsp; 
	The pass waives the entrance fee for up to (15) people total if all arriving 
	in the same vehicle.&nbsp; The pass is a better value if a pilot flies 
	in the Park often (or uses any other of the dozens of State Parks in Texas).&nbsp; 
	To purchase an annual Texas Park Pass, call 800-792-1112 press 3 and then 3 
	again and have your credit card ready.&nbsp; The Pass may also be purchased at
	<a href="FMSPContacts.htm">Park headquarters</a> Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. or at 
	the Tom Mays Unit booth on Saturdays and Sundays, 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p>3.&nbsp; Be a member of the RGSA (optional).&nbsp; The cost is $ 25/year.&nbsp; 
	The <a href="http://www.RGSA.info">Rio Grande Soaring Association</a> pays 
	for the <a href="http://www.ushpa.aero/documents/SOP/SOP-06-01.pdf">USHPA 
	site insurance</a> for the launch sites in Franklin Mountains State Park.&nbsp; 
	Donations are appreciated if you do not wish to become a member.&nbsp; 
	Funds can be mailed to:&nbsp; RGSA 5134 Thornton St., El Paso, TX 79932.</p>
