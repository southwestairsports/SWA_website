	<h1>Valle de Bravo, MEXICO</h1>
		<p>N19.06178 W100.09041&nbsp;7,700' MSL 2,200' AGL&nbsp; Not rated.&nbsp; 
		We suggest H/P3 or H/P2 with an instructor present.</p>
	<p>For general maps (JPG), Google Earth KMZ files of landmarks, and Garmin 
	GDB waypoint files of the area, go to <a href="Maps/vbmaps.htm">this page</a>.&nbsp; 
	We highly recommend that Garmin owners purchase a detailed
	<a href="http://www.cartografiagps.com/mape32/index.htm">topographic map of 
	Mexico</a>.&nbsp; In case you go down somewhere, you will also have a map of 
	the roads so that you can walk out if you have to. Below, flying above 
	cloudbase about 4.5 northeast of launch 10,000' MSL.</p>

	<p>There are few places in the world where a pilot can develop his 
	thermalling skills as here – beginning to advanced.&nbsp; The launch area is 
	the top of a ridge and faces WSW.&nbsp; Thermals to the immediate left of 
	launch are remarkably consistent averaging about 500'/min from about 10:30AM 
	 –  4:00PM CST for the winter season which spans most of November - February.&nbsp; 
	Cycles average about 5 minutes in length.&nbsp; Pilots with modest 
	thermalling skills can get 2,000'-3,000' above launch.&nbsp; Getting this 
	high is required to easily glide to other beautiful sites nearby.&nbsp; 
	Pilots who get low at launch routinely can have multiple chances to find 
	another thermal in the same location or thermals farther out in front.&nbsp; 
	Thermals consistently pop off the spine to the south (left) of launch which 
	zigzags its way up from the valley below.</p>
	<p><img alt="Valle de Bravo" src="65541.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>Dangers at the site are minimal.&nbsp; Most mishaps&nbsp; happen at 
	launch to pilots with poor kiting skills.&nbsp; Common sense is required.&nbsp; 
	Never get low downwind of the numerous ridges, mountains, and peaks as the 
	mixture of sink, rotor, and turbulence can be severe, especially behind the 
	launch area.&nbsp; Keeping at least 1,000' above the terrain downwind of any 
	geography is advisable.&nbsp; (Note:&nbsp; these guidelines apply to any 
	thermally site.)&nbsp; All pilots should keep a safe LZ in view within an 
	easy glide at all times for safety.&nbsp; Our trips to VB are hosted by Jeff 
	Hunt of <a href="http://www.flymexico.com">Fly Mexico</a>.&nbsp; Jeff takes 
	care of transportation, retrieves, accommodations (1st class or bunkhouse  –  
	whatever you can afford), adult beverages after the day's adventure, where 
	to eat, translation, and just about any need a pilot might have.&nbsp; To 
	sum up, pilots need only focus on their flying adventures.&nbsp; Here is a 
	link with information on a <a href="vbhost/VBHosted.htm">typical hosted trip</a> 
	with Jeff Hunt.</p>

	<p>Valle de Bravo has pilots coming from all over the world during the 
	flying season and can be crowded around the Christmas holidays.&nbsp; 
	Consequently, all pilots must learn some skills in flying with others.&nbsp; 
	One of the most difficult is safely flying in a gaggle of 30 pilots or more. 
	While it is easier to thermal (the other pilots can will act as guides to 
	the lift), the primary concern is not colliding with other pilots. Often 
	gaggles contain inexperienced or careless pilots who are a nuisance or 
	danger to everyone. Aggressive and rude pilots are also annoying. But this 
	is almost always true only at launch. Once you get cross country, the 
	numbers drop 80% and you usually fly only with those who are experienced. 
	And here is the treat: Thermalling with 2-4 other pilots can be outstanding 
	because the small gaggle can really zero on the core of the thermal. So, 
	when conditions weaken (as they always do), the gaggle has a greater chance 
	of staying aloft than the single pilot.&nbsp; I once flew in a gaggle with 
	two German pilots out in the flats  –  we would have all sunk out if we had 
	not focused on each other every moment.&nbsp; As it was, we carefully 
	climbed to altitude in a very weak thermal –  and went far, far away.&nbsp; 
	It was hard work as it takes 100% of every bit of mental skill one has.&nbsp; 
	But it is always worth it as the thrill of defying gravity without the use 
	of any other power but the sun is without comparison. La Torre launch above

	<p>Valle de Bravo (VB), Mexico is the quaint town that hosts this amazing 
	site.&nbsp; (Here is a 
	<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Valle+de+Bravo,+Mexico&amp;sll=19.29397,-99.646683&amp;sspn=0.164612,0.307274&amp;gl=us&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=19.196729,-100.132999&amp;spn=0.082355,0.153637&amp;z=13&amp;iwloc=A">map of VB</a>.)&nbsp; While this site can be challenging to expert pilots, the 
	conditions in early December are mild which are ideal for recreational 
	pilots.&nbsp; It is also relatively uncrowded at this time of the year.&nbsp; 
	VB has about 20,000 people and is nestled deep in the mountains of central 
	Mexico on the eastern shore of a beautiful lake.&nbsp; The east side of the 
	town meets the side of a mountain which is used for afternoon ridge soaring 
	by pilots (photo below).</p>

	<p>A typical day begins with a breakfast at one of the many restaurants in 
	this ancient town.&nbsp; At around 10 AM, it is important to set out for the 
	launch area south of town (about 15 miles) called El Peñon (the pointed rock 
	peak in the photo lower right).&nbsp; From here, pilots can choose to enjoy 
	the view, help other pilots, take a sled ride to the huge LZ to the west, or 
	try their skills at working the thermals that are abundant in the area.&nbsp; 
	The air is predictable at this time of year.&nbsp; Pilots can choose to fly 
	to "The Wall" via El Peñon and, if they like, setup for a XC trip back to VB 
	or elsewhere.&nbsp; Another favorite route is to go east and follow the 
	valley behind launch to an excellent luncheon hang-out called Javon's.&nbsp; 
	Pilots can enjoy simple but first class Mexican fare that is prepared on the 
	spot.&nbsp; You don't even have to know Spanish as it is like a buffet.&nbsp; 
	(Generally, the food in central Mexico is much like border food but not as 
	spicy.)&nbsp; These are some of the routes pilots can try.&nbsp; If you 
	don't make a destination, Jeff will see to it that you are picked up 
	wherever it might be or, if you are far off the beaten track, help you get a 
	cab back to VB.&nbsp; After a pleasant lunch, we pile in the van again and 
	head back to VB for an afternoon of whatever you want:&nbsp; Exploring VB, 
	shopping, resting, or heading to the soaring ridge behind VB for more flying 
	(see photo below).</p>
