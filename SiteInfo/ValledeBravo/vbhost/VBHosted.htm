	<p><a href="http://www.flymex.com/mexico/Photo_Album/Album1.html">Valle de 
	Bravo</a> (VB), Mexico has some of the
	<a href="http://www.flymex.com/mexico/Photo_Album/Album3.html">finest flying</a> 
	in the world for paragliders and hang gliders.&nbsp; (Go here for a
	<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Valle+de+Bravo,+Mexico&amp;sll=19.29397,-99.646683&amp;sspn=0.164612,0.307274&amp;gl=us&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=19.196729,-100.132999&amp;spn=0.082355,0.153637&amp;z=13&amp;iwloc=A">map of VB</a>.)&nbsp; While this site can be challenging to expert pilots, the 
	conditions in early December are mild which are ideal for recreational 
	pilots (us).&nbsp; It is also relatively un-crowded at this time of the 
	year.&nbsp; VB is a town of about 20,000 nestled deep in the mountains of 
	central Mexico on the eastern shore of a beautiful lake.&nbsp; The west side 
	of the town meets the side of a mountain which is used for afternoon ridge 
	soaring by pilots.</p>
	<p>Both pilots and guests are welcome!&nbsp; Don't speak Spanish?&nbsp; Not 
	traveled in Mexico before? No problem.&nbsp; Your hosts are experienced 
	guides in Mexico are there to help.&nbsp; The people of VB are friendly and 
	helpful.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Valle de Bravo Mexico" src="DSC00601.JPG" width="448" height="336" class="imgftright">After arriving in Mexico City we take the bus to Toluca and then by a 
	private van to Valle de Bravo.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mexican buses are more like 
	airplanes in the U.S.  –  there is a hostess, refreshments, movies, and 
	comfortable seats.</p>
	<p>There is plenty to do for non-flying
	<a href="http://www.flymex.com/mexico/Photo_Album/Album5.html">guests</a>.</p>
	<p>The package includes everything except meals and the round-trip bus &amp; 
	airfare.&nbsp; Travel to and from Mexico requires a U.S. passport.</p>
	<p>Our accommodations are a nice hotel in the center of town, the Casa 
	Abierta.&nbsp; Bunkhouses are also available for about $20/night.</p>
	<p>A typical day begins with a lazy breakfast at one of the many restaurants 
	in this ancient town.&nbsp; At around 10 AM, we take a van to the main 
	launch site south of town (about 15 miles) called El Peñon (the pointed rock 
	peak in the photo lower right).&nbsp; From here, pilots can choose to enjoy 
	the view, help other pilots, take a sled ride to the huge LZ to the west, or 
	try their skills at working the large and gentle thermals that are abundant 
	in the area.&nbsp; The air is predictable at this time of year.&nbsp; We 
	often fly as a group but it is not necessary.&nbsp; Pilots can choose to fly 
	to "The Wall" via El Peñon and, if they like, setup for a XC trip back to 
	VB.&nbsp; Another favorite route is to go east and follow the valley behind 
	launch to our favorite luncheon hang-out where pilots enjoy simple but first 
	class Mexican fare that is prepared on the spot.&nbsp; (Generally, the food 
	in central Mexico is much like border food but not as spicy.)&nbsp; These 
	are some of the routes pilots can try.&nbsp; If you don't make a 
	destination, we will see to it that you are picked up wherever it might be.&nbsp; 
	After an easy lunch, we pile in the van again and head back to VB for an 
	afternoon of whatever you want:&nbsp; Exploring VB, shopping, resting, or 
	taking the van to the soaring ridge behind VB for more flying (see photo 
	just below).&nbsp; Often, pilots can have a relaxed afternoon soaring back 
	and forth directly overhead the town (be sure not to fall asleep!)&nbsp; The 
	lake flow usually continues late into the afternoon.&nbsp; As it dies down, 
	pilots all head to the LZ which is right on the VB lakefront and can take 
	advantage of the bars and restaurants which surround the LZ.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Valle de Bravo Mexico" src="DSC00642.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>From then on, the evening is yours – from having a relaxed dinner at one 
	of the restaurants in VB to strolling the streets and waterfront.&nbsp; VB 
	is a family oriented town so all of it is safe to stroll at any time of day 
	or night.&nbsp; The town square is busy until late in the evening as the 
	town people enjoy music, food, and the dozens of vendors who set up shop for 
	the occasion.&nbsp; Our accommodations are close to it all so we can walk 
	everywhere.</p>
	<p>Our schedule is not a busy one – relaxation and safe flying are our 
	goals.</p>
	<p>Below is a view east from "The Wall" looking right at El Peñon with the 
	huge extinct volcano Nevado de Toluca looming in the background.&nbsp; It is 
	so high that the daily adiabatic flow towards it affects VB and causes the 
	pleasant ridge soaring conditions there.&nbsp; Launch is the little white patch on the ridge behind and just to the 
	right of El Peñon.</p>

	<p>Instead of a "drive in" for lunch, we have a "fly in".&nbsp; Our favorite 
	place is the little house about 1/2 mile in front of the dog leg in the road 
	(not visible).&nbsp; You pretty much can pick your LZ from anywhere.&nbsp; 
	The glider to the center left is going to land near the restaurant.</p>

	<p>The friendly kitchen staff and the wonderful food they prepare – right in 
	front of your eyes!&nbsp; (And the price is about $4 for lunch.)</p>
