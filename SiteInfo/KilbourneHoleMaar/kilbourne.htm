	<h1>Kilbourne Hole maar </h1>
		<p>Doña Ana County, New Mexico; east launch 31.968833°&nbsp;-106.953967°, 
		4,360 MSL 440' AGL (main LZ); rated H/P2 east launch; H/P3 north launch;

	<p>Soaring a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilbourne_Hole">maar</a> 
	is unusual because it can be flown with winds from most any direction.&nbsp; 
	A pilot can soar around the rim and find the "sweet spot" for that 
	particular wind direction.&nbsp; This is a very thermic site because of the 
	abundance of black basalt around the rim.&nbsp; Consequently, winds at 
	launch can be exceedingly turbulent when the sun is out.&nbsp; 
	If a pilot wants to only ridge soar, the best times are late in the day or 
	when it is overcast.&nbsp; If the winds are too high at launch, wait until 15 minutes before sunset and launch.&nbsp; After sunset, the winds almost always die off near the surface but if a pilot 
	launches at sunset and gets a few hundred feed high, he will be in the winds aloft and not be affected by the inversion and soar until it is too dark to see.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>WARNING:&nbsp; While soaring, the moment the pilot gets less than 25' 
	below launch, MOVE out in front of the basalt cliff towards the LZ.&nbsp; 
	The bottom of the rim near the top of this cliff is strewn with boulders and 
	rocks and is NOT a good landing area. Less experienced pilots should do a 
	sled ride from launch to the LZ if ridge soaring conditions are weak or 
	"iffy".&nbsp; Remember to always head for the LZ if you find yourself below 
	launch.</p>
	<p>Thermalling above Kilbourne Hole maar.&nbsp; The black basalt cliffs 
	(middle right) just off launch are the source for the thermal the pilot is 
	climbing in. The pilot here first got up with ridge lift and then found a 
	thermal out front to get even higher.</p>
	<p>
<img alt="Kilbourne Hole maar" src="Therm.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>Marginally flyable with winds from the southeast and south.&nbsp; Somewhat better with winds from the southwest.&nbsp; When winds are west or 
	northwest it is the best.&nbsp; The black basalt gets intensely hot and generates powerful thermals which, during the heat of the day, block the winds making soaring difficult to say nothing of 
	excessive turbulence.&nbsp; The bottom of the maar 
	has lighter winds so the LZ is always a safe bailout in case high winds are 
	encountered at the rim.&nbsp;Getting blown over the back of the rim is not an 
	issue except that a pilot may get his glider in the bushes.&nbsp; The LZ is 
	a huge (1/4 mile on each side) grassy/weed area that is free of obstacles.&nbsp; 
	Please keep an eye out for the occasional drain holes (6" in diameter or so) 
	that go from the surface to the lava dome deep in the earth.&nbsp; This is 
	why the bottom of the maar is not a lake.</p>
	<p>Flying along the north section of the eastern rim.&nbsp; Winds were WSW 
	at around 12 mph.&nbsp;&nbsp; East launch is behind the pilot.</p>

	<p>Kilbourne Hole maar is one of just a few places in the world where the 
	mineral <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peridot">Green Peridot</a> (an 
	olivine crystal) can be found.&nbsp; However, the mineral found here is not of particularly good quality.</p>
	<p>Below, soaring high above the east rim of the maar.&nbsp; The LZ is just 
	visible to the left.</p>

	<p>View of the east launch site from near the LZ (good for south, southwest, 
	west, and northwest winds).&nbsp; The black basalt cliff to the lower right 
	is an excellent thermal generator.&nbsp; Pilots can easily find thermals 
	just off launch on bright sunny days.</p>
	<p>

	<p>The east launch (in photo above) is the best because 1.) It is the 
	highest part of the rim with the most lift and 2.) The prevailing winds are 
	from the SW most of the year. &nbsp;This launch is good with winds from the southwest to the northwest.&nbsp; It 
	can even be flown with winds from the south but the soaring range is only 
	about 75 yd.  –  a good challenge as the pilot must be constantly turning 
	back and fourth.&nbsp; It is better to use the north launch if winds are south or southeast.&nbsp; Top landing is easy anywhere around the rim as it is 
	clear of obstacles and rotor.&nbsp; The east launch can be easily flown by 
	H/P2's as it is the closest to the LZ and an easy sled ride.&nbsp; The 
	safest turn is to the right as it puts the LZ closer in case conditions are 
	very weak.&nbsp; Other launch sites around the rim (depending on wind 
	direction) require more skill and are rated H/P3 with an instructor present.</p>

	that day and everyone got up!</p>

	<p>Pilots should stay back near the top of the rim which is the area of 
	maximum lift if altitude is less than 100' AGL.&nbsp; If winds are less than 9 mph, plan on doing a sled ride 
	as there is not enough lift to keep a pilot up.&nbsp; Pilots do not want to 
	land at the base of the rim (just above the basalt cliff) as there are 
	boulders everywhere.&nbsp; With moderate winds, it should be no problem to 
	stay 100' over launch.&nbsp; Winds of 14+ will take the pilot to at least 
	200' over launch.&nbsp; Once a pilot gets 200'+ AGL, the lift zone gets much wider, laminar, and more consistent&nbsp; It is a breathtaking to soar a maar as a pilot can 
	safely explore the limits of the lift in either direction.&nbsp; If you do 
	this, be prepared to top land at any time.</p>
	<p>Instructor Had Robinson soaring Kilbourne Hole maar  –  looking south.&nbsp; 
	Launch is about a mile in the distance.&nbsp; Note that it is a somewhat 
	overcast day.&nbsp; When the sun is out, abundant thermal blocking of the 
	winds at launch occur and it is harder to soar but easy to catch thermals.

	<p>Soaring 600' over  –  a record for this maar.&nbsp; Launch is directly 
	below.&nbsp; The winds this day were SW at 15 -18 mph at launch.&nbsp; View 
	is south.&nbsp; No one is yet sure how this altitude was reached but was 
	probably a combination of a huge thermal generated in front of launch and 
	ridge lift.&nbsp; No one has yet gone XC from Kilbourne Hole maar.</p>

	<h2>Caution</h2>
	<p>Southwest of the east rim launch at the base is a small canyon 
	just east and behind the basalt cliff.&nbsp; If a pilot is ridge soaring the 
	SW face of the east rim launch in weak conditions and he drops below launch, 
	he should stay clear of this area as there is significant shadow/rotor 
	behind the canyon at the base of the launch and he will quickly sink out.&nbsp; 
	In high wind conditions, there may be strong rotor.&nbsp; Side hill 
	landing, however, behind the canyon and at the base of launch is possible 
	but there are boulders close by.&nbsp; Landing in this area is an advanced 
	skill.&nbsp; A better and safer place to side hill land is more south of 
	launch in weakening conditions.&nbsp; A side hill landing in this area is 
	fairly easy and much safer.&nbsp; It is important for the pilot to always be 
	aware of weakening conditions and be prepared to immediately side hill land 
	or go to the LZ.</p>
	<p>View of east launch from the south  –  note the clear, open area!</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Kilbourne Hole maar" src="LaunchSouth.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>The LZ is huge but it is surrounded by mesquite.&nbsp; It's a 30 minute 
	drive to the bottom of Kilbourne on a rough and steep road (4 wheel drive 
	only with low pressure in tires).&nbsp; Pilots can always hike back to 
	launch with their gear  –  about 45 minutes.</p>
	<p>Turbulence is minimal at Kilbourne.&nbsp; First time pilots should have a 
	guide if they are not experienced P3's with mountain launch skills. This 
	site has some cell service at the top of the rim but is unreliable.&nbsp; 
	Ham radio (147.160 mHz) or satellite phone is the only reliable means of communications.&nbsp; 
	Do not fly this site alone without checking in with someone.&nbsp; Kilbourne 
	is remote and is a "dark sky" site (no electric lights) = a beautiful place 
	to camp.&nbsp; The night sky is a brilliant display.</p>
	<p>View of the LZ (light area) from the east launch.&nbsp; It is a 1/4 mile 
	in diameter, flat, and easy to land it.</p>
