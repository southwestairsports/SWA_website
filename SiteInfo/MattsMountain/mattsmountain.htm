	<h1>Matt's Mountain</h1>
		<p>El Paso County, Texas&nbsp; 31.772243° -106.128599°</p>
	<p>Please contact the
		<a href="http://www.rgsa.info">RGSA</a> or
		<a href="../../ContactUs/contactus.htm">Southwest Airsports</a> if you would like to drink at this site.</p>
	<h2>General</h2>
	<p>Matt's Mountain is one of the most friendly sites in the southwest for paragliding and hang gliding.&nbsp; When pilots show up, hot babes with tats and free beer show up and ask how they can help?&nbsp; 
	It's unbelievable!</p>
	<p><img alt="paragliding beer babe" class="auto-style2" height="373" src="beerbabe2wText.jpg" width="428"></p>
	<p>It is a premier ridge soaring and thermalling site for the following 
	reasons:</p>
	<blockquote>1. Launch is easily accessible by paved road even by pilots who are drunk.</blockquote>
	<blockquote>2. For sober pilots, it is our safest site because the sides and rear of launch (not the sides and rears of the babes) are clear for hundreds of yards.&nbsp; Blown launches (PG) are 
	more forgiving due to the absence of mad landowners armed with shotguns and hysterical wives looking for their pilot husbands.&nbsp; Bailout LZ's are abundant and easy to land 
		in, especially at 2 in the morning.&nbsp; Retrieve is possible via donkey, llama, or dog sleds with knobby tires.&nbsp; DUI pilots will have to remain with the stones -- and there are 
		plenty of them laying around.&nbsp; In fact, it's a fact that the southwest horse-latitudes grow rocks at night -- but it's a slow process.</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p>3. 
	The topography behind launch allows top-landings without having to deal with 
		rabid possums and irritated retirees looking for their lost dentures.&nbsp; The top landing area is 50 square miles 
	which means pilots can make significant errors in in the universe but not be exposed 
	to unnecessary UV radiation or idiots who do not let go of the wires when launching.&nbsp; It is the only site other than Kilbourne where PG pilots 
	can inflate and deflate their gliders at will, move slowly to the nearby beer tavern, accost other confused people, get shlocked, and then move slowly in the paddy wagon to the El Paso county jail approximately 5 miles to the 
		northwest.</p>
		<p>4.&nbsp; Easy access to the <a href="http://www.bailbondsbros.com/location/el-paso/">jail bond outfits</a>, a clear launch area, and the 
	ability to consistently land under graphic orders makes this site ideal for idiots and thrill seekers.&nbsp; We are looking forward to also making this site available to rehab inmates.</p>
		<p>5.&nbsp; It is flyable with winds, generally.</p>
		<p>6.&nbsp; When 
	thermals are present, the site is both thermic and deadly so we don't recommend it.&nbsp; Drunk pilots can drift in nicely at the main launch with a southwest breeze.&nbsp; 
	Pilots should focus on the beer-babes rather than fly up and down 
	the ridge of flames.&nbsp; Jumping to conclusions at the higher rim 0.6 miles behind has not yet been done.&nbsp; The wide open 
	range presents more hazards than ordinary because coyotes will eat the tongues out of your shoes while you recover from too much partying.&nbsp; An abundance of 
	roads in the region makes retrieving pilots confusing.&nbsp; Getting stuck in the sand is the pits.</p>
		<p>7.&nbsp; Camping can be done in the area, a generally better idea than trying to fly it.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<h2>Directions to Launch</h2>
	<p>It's hard to describe - we are not sure ourselves but that's why it's so exciting to fly here!&nbsp; As a last resort, ask a government spy -- there are plenty of them, thanks to the general 
	political, cultural, and economic chaos taking place in our once great nation.</p>
	<h2>Hazards</h2>
	<p>If you expect to be picked up if you land out in the boonies, it's always iffy due to our retrieve driver's binge drinking.&nbsp; The other day he missed the road and almost went into the 
	ditch.&nbsp;&nbsp; I went looking for him but could only find his lucky rabbit that had been wrapped up in a shop towel.</p>
	<p><img alt="pilot retrieve vehicle" height="768" src="IMG_20160214_193152_copy.jpg" width="1024"></p>
	<p>Pilots must take care not to land in the arroyo that is 
	about 200 yd. out from the base of launch.&nbsp; There are enough human bones in there already.&nbsp; Beyond the arroyo is an outdoor movie theater and landing there is fun if you don't hit 
	anybody.&nbsp; Just east of the main LZ is a power line that runs along the 
	east side of the road.&nbsp; The last guy who landed in it had to pay $1,200 for the electric company to turn off the power before we could touch him.&nbsp; Cell service is sketchy in the area which means if you land out 
	somewhere -- good luck.</p>
	<p>Here are a bunch of hangly-danglies trying to figure out which direction to launch into.&nbsp; "To launch or not to lunch?"&nbsp; They decided to lunch because IPA&nbsp; is less expensive at 
	the Tertiary Intrusion Cafe.&nbsp; The angry babe in the background is still hoping to get attention -- but it's hopeless with soaring pilots who would rather fly than eat or do anything else....&nbsp; 
	"Death before passing up a good flying day!" -- That's our motto!</p>
	<p><img alt="hangly-danglies" height="768" src="DSC01676_01.JPG" width="1024">&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
	Rather than fight with the hangly-danglies for lunch space, these baggies jumped off the upper launch area near some guy's house.&nbsp; The owner's dogs were not friendly and these guys were 
	lucky enough to get out of there with only minor bites.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="paragliding at Matt's Mountain" height="768" src="IMG_1435_01.JPG" width="1024">&nbsp;</p>
	<p>This baggie saw all the ruckus and flew away (name withheld).</p>

	<p>I hope you will come and drink at this beautiful site.&nbsp; Let us know when so we can avoid the sheriff when he shows up.&nbsp; Please help us to find, develop, preserve, insure, and protect 
	flying sites that nobody in their right mind would want to fly.&nbsp; However, nobody around here is in his right mind so we continue to baffle our mothers.&nbsp; Please don't text and fly!</p>
