	<h1>Windy Point</h1>
		<p>Alto, NM 33.396142° -105.764624° 1,950' AGL launch&nbsp; 10,000' MSL&nbsp; 
		Rated H/P3 or H/P2 with an instructor present.</p>

	<p>This amazing thermalling site is the result of the tireless efforts of 
	Riker Davis (H5) of Ruidoso, NM.</p>
	<p>Windy Point is on Hwy. 532 (Ski Run Rd) near mile marker 10, faces east, 
	and can be flown with light and variable winds anywhere from northeast to 
	southeast. It is best in the AM on days that begin clear.&nbsp; Cumulus 
	development is inevitable later in the morning and conditions remain good to 
	about 11:30AM when OD begins.&nbsp; Some of the best days are those with 
	zero winds forecast  –  when you expect light and variable conditions.&nbsp; 
	This site is strictly thermal as ridge lift created by easterly winds is 
	turbulent from the many peaks, spines, and canyons in the vicinity.&nbsp; 
	The magic of Windy Point results from the east facing terrain heating up 
	from the early morning sun.&nbsp; This creates the upslope thermal cycles 
	which provide light to soarable lift starting around 9AM.&nbsp; During the 
	monsoon season (July and August) it can OD early and the window to fly and 
	land can close before 10AM.&nbsp; Past this time, lift becomes extreme and 
	pilots can encounter virga, rain, and/or hail.&nbsp; During other times of 
	the year the site can be flyable all day if winds are light and variable.&nbsp;

	<p>Below, Riker Davis about to launch from Windy Point.</p>

	<p>The HG launch is right off the edge of the Windy Point scenic overlook. 
	Space is available for only 4 or 5 steps so at least an 8 mph wind is needed 
	for a safe launch. PG pilots should use the upper launch as it gives plenty 
	of space and time to find a thermal and go up. It is a 15 minute hike 
	through pleasant mountain meadows. The ambitious may also launch about 50 
	yards above the HG launch area if the winds are 7-8 or more. There are a few 
	trees to steer through here but enough wind velocity makes it doable.</p>
	<p>Riker heads out but he won't be in the air for long as OD is about to 
	begin.&nbsp; Rain is already visible in the distance.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Windy Point Ruidoso, NM" src="Copy%20of%20DSC00875.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>The LZ (on Mescalero land) is easily visible from the HG launch but is 
	just out of site from the PG upper launch. The LZ is a grassy meadow between 
	the two fishing lakes in the canyon, an easy glide below. It is high at 
	8,200 ft but is plenty big for safe landings by both HG and PG pilots.</p>
	<p>This is the view from 100 yards below and south of the upper PG launch.&nbsp; 
	An arrow marks the LZ.</p>

	<p>Windy Point is an insured site and all pilots must be members of USHPA.&nbsp; 
	Visitors from outside the U.S. may obtain 30 day temporary memberships from 
	any local USHPA chapter including the <a href="http://www.rgsa.info">Rio 
	Grande Soaring Association</a>.&nbsp; Please contact them if you would like 
	to fly the site or need more information.&nbsp; The Mescalero Apache Indian 
	Tribe graciously allows pilots to land at their campground.&nbsp; Pilots in 
	the LZ are subject to Indian Tribal law so please be respectful and 
	appreciative.&nbsp; The campground is closed October through April so if one 
	attempts flying in the winter you will have to walk out almost a mile to the 
	locked gate at Ski Run road.&nbsp; PG pilots, however, can land on the road 
	near the gate and save themselves a long hike as the road is closed and 
	there is no traffic.</p>
	<p>View east from the upper PG launch.&nbsp; Note the moisture in the air  –  
	in less than an hour there will be towering cumulus clouds everywhere.&nbsp; 
	The LZ is just below the tree line to the lower right.</p>
	<p>
<img alt="Windy Point Ruidoso, NM" src="Copy%20of%20DSC00970.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>View looking up from the upper PG launch.&nbsp; Sierra Blanca (left) and 
	Lookout Mountain (right) are visible in the background.&nbsp; The entire 
	launch area is thick grass.&nbsp; It is safe and easy to launch here and 
	there is plenty of space to recover from mistakes.&nbsp; Tired pilots can 
	easily take a nap and relax....&nbsp; This is one of the only launch sites 
	in the southwest that is huge and grassy.</p>
	<p>

	<p>Another view straight down the upper PG launch run.&nbsp; A pilot can run 
	forever downhill in light winds but it's important to turn right and get out 
	in front and over the spines (where the thermals release).&nbsp; There is a 
	lot of sink straight out from launch, as we would expect over a canyon. </p>

	<p>View looking back up to the HG launch area from the LZ.&nbsp; Pilots 
	should land when the clouds become towering as the lift under them is very 
	strong.&nbsp; This pilot experienced 1,000'+/min lift at just 10AM in the 
	morning out in front.</p>
