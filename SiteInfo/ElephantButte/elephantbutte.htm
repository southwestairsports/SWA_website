	<h1>Elephant Butte Lake State Park </h1>
		<p>33.296153° -107.176068° 4,390' MSL PPG only at this time. S. 
		Monticello Campground &amp; Boat Ramp  –  electric and water hookups are 
		available but no sewer.&nbsp; A dump station is provided nearby for 
		convenience.&nbsp; Rates are $14/day.&nbsp; For more info and to make 
		reservations online, go
		<a href="http://newmexicostateparks.reserveamerica.com/welcome.do?topTabIndex=-1">
		here</a>.&nbsp; When flying in the Park, STAY AWAY FROM ALL CAMPS, RV 
		PARKS, AND BOATS.&nbsp; It is against FAA regulations to fly over any 
		congested area.&nbsp; Do NOT fly during quiet hours which are 10PM to 
		7AM.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Flying above or at the edge of the lake ensures smooth air during the day 
	even from the late spring to the early fall.&nbsp; The cool lake surface 
	suppresses thermal formation and is an area of great sink.&nbsp; These 
	factors ensure calm air making it easy and fun to fly in.&nbsp; Pilots will 
	immediately notice the change in air as they venture inland during hot days.&nbsp; 
	At the extremes of the day, pilots can safely leave the lake area.</p>
	<p>

	<p>With the water very low in the lake, there are numerous boat ramps that 
	are temporarily closed but provide outstanding launch areas for PPG.&nbsp; 
	The launch below is workable with winds from east to south.&nbsp; The broad 
	and sloping concrete ramp has good footing and is free of sand, rocks, and 
	obstacles in front.&nbsp; The closer to the lake a pilot launches, the 
	smoother and more steady the air will be.</p>
	<p>View below is east.&nbsp; Pilots can launch crosswind near the bottom of 
	the ramp into winds more from the south.</p>
	<p>

	<p>
 Pilots should land upwind on the beach if flying during the heat 
	of the day.&nbsp; During the summer months, density altitude and high 
	temperatures combine to negatively affect paramotor performance.&nbsp; 
	Please keep this in mind!</p>
	<p>Pilots Lee Boone and Had Robinson have both experienced "inversion 
	surfing."&nbsp; This is the phenomena when there is an inversion over the 
	lake and winds aloft are strong.&nbsp; The fast moving upper air contacts 
	the edge of the cold inversion over the lake and is deflected up.&nbsp; Lift 
	can be a few hundred feet per second or more and is soarable.</p>
	<p>View below is southeast – there is plenty of room to run with sure 
	footing and no obstacles.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Elephant Butte State Park" src="IMG_0317.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>It is always tempting to launch from the roads or areas inland but it can 
	be risky to do so because of numerous obstacles and the presence of powerful 
	thermals that can make the air gusty and switchy during most of the day.</p>
	<p>Below – the east shore of the lake towards the north end.&nbsp; This side 
	of the lake has smoother air because the west facing hills and buttes tend 
	to draw the cold lake air in more strongly than the flatter west side of the 
	lake.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Elephant Butte State Park" src="IMG_0308.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>It is easy to see the wind direction on the surface of the lake.</p>
	<p>

	<p>Fly safely and be sure to stay away from the campgrounds.</p>
