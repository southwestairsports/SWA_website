	<h1>Woods Hole &amp; the Elizabeth Islands, Massachusetts</h1>
		<p>launch/LZ N41.52935° W70.67043° MSL 10'; PPG ONLY -- ADVANCED SKILLS 
		REQUIRED</p>
	<p>Great Harbor, Penzance Point, and the Elizabeth Islands stretching west 
	into the distance</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Woods Hole and the Elizabeth Islands, Massachusetts" src="Elizabeth-Islands.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>The area is a magical mix of of ocean and land.&nbsp; It 
	is relatively un-crowded.&nbsp; The Elizabeth Islands are privately owned 
	and the trustees have graciously allowed a few areas for public use, 
	including Tarpaulin Cove, Kettle Cove, Bull Island, the Weepecket Islands, 
	and West Beach.&nbsp; Cuttyhunk Island has a small village and was once home 
	to U-Boat lookout stations during WWII.&nbsp; Pilots will find the isolated 
	Tarpaulin Cove the easiest to land/launch from.</p>
	<h2>Launch, LZ and Bailout</h2>
	<p>The Woods Hole ballpark is the only flat and somewhat clear 
	pilots can use.&nbsp;&nbsp; The trees cause 
	turbulence and rotor, especially in high winds.&nbsp; Though this is not particularly 
	dangerous, pilots need to ensure that they launch at trim speed and not do any 
	turns or maneuvers until well away from the terrain.&nbsp; The air can be 
	all over the place....<p>&nbsp;Here is a view of 
	the ballpark looking east.<p><img alt="Woods Hole and the Elizabeth Islands, Massachusetts" src="2882.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>If the 
	ballpark has activity, it is easy to land in the bailout but requires 
	walking 
	through Poison Ivy where it connects with the ballpark.&nbsp; The owners of 
	the marsh have graciously given pilots permission to land but they first 
	must identify themselves.&nbsp; Please
	<a href="../../ContactUs/contactus.htm">contact us</a> for the details.</p>
	<p>If winds are high, the bailout is a great place to ditch as the ground is 
	essentially matted vegetation and very soft.&nbsp; Both areas are prone 
	to turbulence and rotor because of trees.&nbsp; It is not a good idea to 
	launch if winds are more than 15 anywhere.&nbsp; The
	<a href="http://mesowest.utah.edu/cgi-bin/droman/meso_base_dyn.cgi?stn=BUZM3&amp;unit=0&amp;timetype=LOCAL">
	Buzzards Bay Tower</a> and
	<a href="http://mesowest.utah.edu/cgi-bin/droman/meso_base_dyn.cgi?stn=KPVC&amp;unit=0&amp;timetype=LOCAL">
	Provincetown</a> stations are the most important to check before flying as 
	they are relatively unaffected by land and give the wind direction and speed 
	pilots will experience when flying near the surface of the ocean.&nbsp; 
	Generally, winds pick up in the afternoon and can be 15-20 knots.&nbsp; 
	Always check the forecasts, especially the
	<a href="http://marine.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=41.3998&amp;lon=-70.9824&amp;unit=0&amp;lg=english&amp;FcstType=graphical">
	NWS hourly</a>, for this region.</p>
	<p>Getting caught in the air when it is blowing 25, even though smooth, can 
	be dangerous for landing.&nbsp; Up is west in the photo below.</p>

	<p>Pilots must give way to all other users of the ballpark.&nbsp; Quickly leave the area once 
	you are in 
	the air.&nbsp; The best bailout LZ is the surrounding marsh which is, 
	essentially, like landing in the water because of the great thickness of the 
	marsh vegetation.&nbsp; The downside is that there is a lot of turbulence 
	and rotor in the marsh area but it is still safer to have a hard landing 
	there than risk drowning, going in the trees, or hitting the ground.&nbsp; 
	Once in the marsh, it is a relatively easy walk out, a pilot may have to 
	cross a narrow canal or two.</p>
	<p>Hadley Harbor is surrounded by various islands</p>
	<p>

	<h1>HAZARDS</h1>
	<p>Getting blown out over the ocean could be a disaster if a pilot has to 
	land in the water.&nbsp; It is mandatory to have adequate flotation devices, 
	including an inflatable-type life preserver and equipment like the
	<a href="http://powerfloat.com.au/cms/">Powerfloat</a>.&nbsp; Drowning is 
	the #1 cause of death for PPG pilots and is so easily avoidable.</p>
	<p>Pilots should carry 
	a waterproof strobe, as having to ditch in the water is always a 
	possibility.&nbsp; Ditching in the surf while attached to your glider would 
	probably be fatal.&nbsp; Weather on Cape Cod can be gusty and very windy 
	with little warning.&nbsp; Never fly where there is not a reasonable glide 
	to land as ditching in the ocean would be expensive and possibly dangerous 
	if you are far from land.</p>
	<p>As is true everywhere on planet earth, the Jet Stream can make the air 
	gusty so it is a good idea to stay on the ground when it is near or 
	overhead.</p>
	<h2>WARNING</h2>
	<p>This air space is closely watched by
	<a href="http://www.cbp.gov/border-security/air-sea/operations/locations/am-ops-center">AMOC</a> as VIP's frequently visit the area.&nbsp; All pilots need to check 
	for TFR's and give all inhabited areas wide berth, especially near Woods 
	Hole.&nbsp; Thankfully, the shoreline of the Elizabeth Islands is largely 
	uninhabited so flying low and slow there will not bother anyone.</p>
