	<h1>Anapra Mesa</h1>
		
	<p>31.786567° -106.582500° 4,081' MSL&nbsp; 200' AGL&nbsp; Rated 
	H/P3 or H/P2 with an instructor present.&nbsp; (The rating of the site is 
	due to the fact that there is a barb wire fence right behind the center 
	launch area.)<br><br>Center launch  –  view is SE.&nbsp; Winds were about 
	7-8, just barely strong enough to stay up out in front of the Mesa.&nbsp; 
	Below, Lee Boone kites at the middle launch with Matt Hayes observing.</p>
	<p><img alt="launch" src="DSCN1543_01.JPG" width="1200" height="1600"></p>
	<p>It 
	is only soarable with ENE to SSE winds aloft.&nbsp; Because of the Pass, 
	winds at launch will always be slightly cross (~20°) to the right.&nbsp; If 
	they are anything else pilots can expect some turbulence.&nbsp; Velocity 
	needs to be from 8-14 mph for PG.&nbsp; How to tell without a wind gauge?&nbsp; 
	If the tops of the Creosote bushes at the rim edge are swaying less than 
	3-4", conditions are too weak to stay up.<br><br>Located near the US-Mexican 
	border, it is perfect for new pilots as it has few hazards.&nbsp; The LZ is 
	huge and flat.&nbsp; The site is almost all soft sand and is forgiving of 
	hard landings and other mistakes.&nbsp; Warning: the ridge itself is a 
	calcified escarpment that is sharp and will cut glider lines if they are 
	dragged across it.<br><br>There is significant rotor all along the Mesa 
	close to the rim.&nbsp; Thankfully, the center launch has an elevated row of 
	non-hostile bushes that you can lay your glider on so that it will elevated 
	about 4'.&nbsp; This is just enough to get out of the rotor for an easy 
	inflation.&nbsp; If you are not an experienced kiter, be sure to have help 
	when launching as you do NOT want to be dragged into the barb-wire fence.</p>
	<p><img alt="paragldier at fence" src="DSCN1430_01.JPG" width="900" height="675"></p>
	<p>The south half of Anapra Mesa.&nbsp; Launch is just behind where 
	this photo was taken.&nbsp; Skilled pilots can "park" above the mesa.&nbsp; 
	View here is south.</p>
	<p><img alt="null" src="DSC01393.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>If winds are too strong at launch, wait until 
	later in the day or launch early in the AM.&nbsp; The winds at launch are 
	almost always slightly cross to the south because of the pass and all of the 
	geography out front.&nbsp; When is a good time to fly?&nbsp; Check this
	<a href="anapra-soaring-day.pptx">PowerPoint presentation</a> by Tom Bird of the National Weather Service.&nbsp; 
	It will help.<br><br>The best launch is close to the middle of the mesa where a 
	deep notch comes through.&nbsp; The notch causes the air to flow more 
	smoothly over this part of the rim so there is less turbulence and rotor at 
	launch.&nbsp; It is possible to kite here.<br><br>View below is looking north.&nbsp; 
	The barb wire fence behind the launch area is visible.</p>
	<p><img alt="null" src="07.32.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>In the photo below, pilots can be seen preparing to launch. The far pilot is 
	setting up just below the center launch area (a red bag is just visible).&nbsp; 
	Spreading out below the rim is ALWAYS the safest because if you have a 
	mishap inflating, you will NOT be blown into the barb wire fence that goes 
	along the east edge of the dirt road.&nbsp; These pilots had never flown the 
	site which is why the site guide asked them to launch below the rim.&nbsp; 
	The downside of launching below the rim is that there is more plant debris 
	that can get caught in your glider lines.&nbsp; Skilled desert pilots will 
	know what to do.</p>
	<p><img alt="null" src="DSC01386.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>The south end tends to have more turbulence 
	because of the high border fence.&nbsp; Launching from the south area of the 
	mesa is fine but you will find there is a lot of rotor because of the sharp 
	cliff.&nbsp; This makes getting your glider up more difficult.&nbsp; If you 
	move away from the edge about 15 yards it is usually possible to get out of 
	the rotor enough to inflate.&nbsp; Once your glider is up, there is no rotor 
	and you can move towards the edge easily.<br>Pilots can easily top land 
	anywhere. The south end is safer because the barb wire fence is farther 
	away.&nbsp; If you want to work on your side-hill landing skills, this is 
	the place to do it  –  it's all soft sand and is very forgiving of major 
	errors.&nbsp; If your wing goes into a bush, be prepared to spend some time 
	getting it out.<br><br>When launching from the middle launch area, turn north 
	(though downwind) and fly to near the north end of the mesa. The best lift 
	is between the middle and the north end of the mesa. If you launch and can't 
	keep level with the mesa, you are probably going to sink out. Turn south and 
	side-hill land anywhere on the hill in the soft sand.</p>
	<h2>The Second Wave</h2>
	<p>Skilled pilots can catch the "Second Wave" and park hundreds of feet over 
	launch. The bench area is about half way between launch and the north end of 
	the mesa.&nbsp; The challenge:&nbsp; Positioning yourself in just the right 
	spot in the ridge lift above the Mesa where the standing wave mixes with the 
	ridge lift. You will feel a slight tug and you have to turn in it at just 
	the right moment.&nbsp; Only a handful of pilots have done it.<br>Below, 
	Arizona visiting pilot, Gingher Leyendecker, is parked at the bottom of the 
	"Second Wave".&nbsp; She is the first non-local to get up in it.&nbsp; 
	Remember this is a mere 200' hill  –  how do pilots get up there???&nbsp; See 
	if you can do it.</p>
	<p><img alt="null" src="DSC01395.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>The site has a benign LZ out in front. NEVER 
	park your vehicle near the border (keep away at least 50 yd.)  –  it can be 
	rocked by vandals from Mexico.&nbsp; Do NOT land in Mexico. It's against 
	Mexican law to land there and you will be jailed and/or fined if you get 
	caught plus your glider and gear may be confiscated.&nbsp; If you do wind up 
	over there, you can hightail it for the fence, cross, and then go to the 
	nearest border crossing and tell them what happened.&nbsp; Doing this will 
	keep you lawful and out of trouble with the U.S. authorities.&nbsp; Crossing 
	the border while soaring is up to you  –  be careful! If the wind dies, can 
	you glide back to US airspace?<br><br>The border fence is visible in the photo 
	below and the broad open area in front that is convenient for enhancing your 
	top landing skills.&nbsp; It is the safest spot in the region to practice 
	this.&nbsp; View here is to the south.&nbsp; The international border is the 
	dark fence.</p>

	<p>For directions to the site contact us or the
	<a href="http://www.RGSA.info">RGSA</a>.&nbsp; You have to go through 
	guarded private property to reach launch unless you come from the east side 
	and then it's a 200' vertical climb through soft sand to reach launch.&nbsp; 
	We have the kind permission of the Camino Real Landfill people to trespass.&nbsp; 
	If you want to bring the guards a 6-pack of cold beer/soft-drinks, it would 
	not hurt....</p>
