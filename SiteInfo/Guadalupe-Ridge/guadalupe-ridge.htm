	<h1>Guadalupe Ridge</h1>
	<p>Guadalupe Ridge – Big Dog Canyon 1,600' AGL,&nbsp; 32.084805° 
	-104.809092°, launch 6,000' MSL</p>
	<p>The Ridge is located in the Lincoln National Forest, Otero County, NM.&nbsp; 
	This site is governed the National Forest Service rules which require that 
	visiting pilots be accompanied by a <a href="http://www.rgsa.info/">Rio 
	Grande Soaring Association</a> member.</p>
	<p>The view from launch looking west</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Guadalupe Rim launch area, New Mexico" src="IMG_4419_01.JPG" width="1280" height="960"></p>
	<p>This is a thermal and ridge-soaring site northwest of Carlsbad, New 
	Mexico. It’s rated HG/PG 2 with prior mountain experience. It is the rim of 
	a vast valley that runs about 20 miles due north &amp; south, and may be flown 
	in wind directions ranging from Southwest to due West. The valley is flat 
	and grass covered, about 6:1 from launch, and can be landed anywhere. The 
	site is marginally suitable for top landings because of the steep face of 
	the ridge.&nbsp; When the winds are more than 5-7 mph, the rotor behind 
	launch extends east at least a 1/4 mile.&nbsp; A PG pilot was hurt in 
	the rotor in December 2000.&nbsp; If a top landing is desired, be certain 
	that you have enough altitude to fly behind launch far enough to get out of 
	the rotor.&nbsp; </p>

	<img alt="Guadalupe Rim launch area, New Mexico" src="IMG_4420_01.JPG" width="1280" height="960"></p>
	<p>The setup area can accommodate 50 
	gliders (HG or PG) at once. The most commonly used launch is a dirt slope about 50 feet 
	long, sloping down at 45 degrees. In winds of 20 mph or more, the site 
	becomes turbulent, and a wire crew for HG becomes essential. This site can get very 
	windy indeed, and blowouts are common. Plan to fly early! A sled run is 
	typically 5 to 10 minutes in duration; soaring flights of several hours are 
	also common.</p>

	<img alt="Rio Grande Soaring Association fly-in 2008 at Guadalupe Ridge" src="IMG_4421_01.JPG" width="1280" height="960"></p>
	<p>As of the year 2009, no XC flights have been made from this site. 
	Access is by a graded 2WD road, on US Forest Service land. Access to the LZ 
	in the valley involves an almost-4WD section, however. This site is popular 
	for club campouts, and is very remote. Take lots of extra food, water and 
	gasoline. Sitting Bull Falls, a popular recreation site for swimming in 
	spring-fed pools, is a 2-hour drive from the launch site. Contact 
	<a href="http://www.rgsa.info/">RGSA 
	members</a> for directions.</p>
	<p>PG from this site is "iffy" even during the winter months as conditions tend to be too strong to safely launch and soar the 
	ridge.&nbsp; We are researching better times when PG pilots can safely fly, 
	such as in the fall.&nbsp; </p>
