	<h1>La Luz Launch </h1>
		<p>La Luz, NM&nbsp; 32°58'17.97"N&nbsp; 105°55'1.88"W&nbsp; 5,856' MSL 
		1,100' AGL</p>
	<p>Rated H/P2&nbsp; For directions to launch, contact the
	<a href="http://www.rgsa.info/contact-us/contact-us.htm">RGSA</a>.&nbsp; There 
	are (3) launch areas that favor a particular wind direction.&nbsp; Choose 
	the one that has the air coming in the straightest.&nbsp; PG pilots should 
	be aware that the launch areas were pioneered by HG pilots and are not 
	necessarily that good for PG per having a clean layout area, lack of rotor 
	behind launch near the ground, and a long run area.&nbsp; We do not 
	recommend this site for paragliding because of the tricky winds at launch 
	and strong thermals coming off the city water works holding tanks below 
	launch.&nbsp; If Dry Canyon is not flyable then we recommend that pilots 
	stay on the ground.&nbsp; Numerous pilots have been injured or frightened at 
	La Luz.</p>
	<p>Flyable with southwesterly to northerly winds.&nbsp; It is primarily used 
	when Dry Canyon will not work (when winds are northwest or north).&nbsp; It 
	is safer than Dry Canyon for newer pilots as the LZ is an easy glide from 
	launch.</p>
	<p>IMPORTANT NOTICE:&nbsp; Launching from the steep slopes and cliffs in the 
	desert mountains requires good kiting skills.&nbsp; It is hazardous to 
	inflate and then immediately turn before stabilizing your glider overhead 
	for a few seconds or more.&nbsp; Many pilots have damaged their equipment 
	and been banged-up attempting to launch in the often turbulent air that 
	characterizes the air we fly in.&nbsp; Pilots must have the skills to kite a 
	glider overhead under control before attempting a launch, especially in 
	strong air.&nbsp; In addition, all pilots should master inflating their 
	gliders with the A's in one hand and the C's or D's in the other.&nbsp; You 
	may have to de-power your glider at any moment and this is the only way you 
	can safely do it while attempting a launch.&nbsp; Pulling deep on the brakes 
	does NOT de-power your glider!&nbsp; In addition, you will not have time to 
	go searching for the correct risers if things start to go wrong and you do 
	not have the correct ones in your hands.&nbsp; Jamming the brakes will only 
	make things worse.&nbsp; If you need training on how to do this, we can 
	help.</p>
	<p>The primary LZ is an enormous field about an 8:1 glide off to the west.&nbsp; 
	A sled run is typically 5 minutes in duration, but soaring flights do occur.&nbsp; 
	Directions to the LZ: From Hwy 70/54 go on Hwy 82 east towards Cloudcroft. 
	Take a left at the blinking lights that mark Florida Avenue, and go north 
	about a mile or so to Valley View Drive, about 100 yards before you reach 
	the trees of the village. Go right about ¼ mile to where you can look over 
	the barbed wire into the huge open field. Don’t drive into the field, though 
	– it’s private property. Hazards: There is a power line running from 
	northeast to southwest across the east edge of the field.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>View from the NW launch.&nbsp; This launch is flat and would be rated "C" 
	for PG launching in light winds as the run is short and slightly shadowed by 
	the cliff face.</p>

	<p>Per the image below, when winds are northwest or west, the area of max 
	lift was not the north spine but was the south spine.&nbsp; The sink over 
	the canyon between the two spines was severe – as we would expect.&nbsp; 
	Elevation profiles of the PG track below clearly showed the lift patterns of 
	the spines  –  the south was much more robust.</p>
