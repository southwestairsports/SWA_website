	<h1>Dry Canyon</h1>
		<p>Alamogordo, NM&nbsp; 32° 55.632'N&nbsp; 105°53.145'W&nbsp; 7,013' MSL 
		2,400' AGL&nbsp; Rated H/P3 or H/P2 with a USHPA certified instructor 
		present.</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>A premier world class site for PG and HG that has 
	outstanding views of the Tularosa Basin, White Sands National Monument, the 
	City of Alamogordo, and the Sacramento Mountains.&nbsp; The site was 
	discovered and developed by the local hang gliding community many decades 
	ago.&nbsp; We are very thankful for their pioneering work.&nbsp; This site 
	is consistently better than many other world famous sites such as Valle de 
	Bravo, Mexico.&nbsp; Its southwest face and the bowl shape of the Canyon 
	make for safe launching and ideal thermal and ridge soaring conditions.&nbsp; 
	It is rare when pilots have a sled ride from Dry Canyon.&nbsp; Glass-offs 
	and cross country trips are regular features offered to pilots who fly Dry 
	Canyon.</p>
	<p>The main launch faces southwest over the Tularosa Basin and is at the 
	center of a huge bowl formed by the Sacramento Mountains.&nbsp; View here is 
	to the east with the 10,000' MSL summit of the Sacramento ridge in the far 
	background.</p>

	<h2>IMPORTANT NOTICE</h2>
	<p>Launching from the steep slopes and cliffs in the 
	desert mountains requires good kiting skills.&nbsp; It is hazardous to 
	inflate and then immediately turn before stabilizing your glider overhead 
	for a few seconds or more.&nbsp; Many pilots have damaged their equipment 
	and been banged-up attempting to launch in the often turbulent air that 
	characterizes the air we fly in.&nbsp; Pilots must have the skills to kite a 
	glider overhead under control before attempting a launch, especially in 
	strong air.&nbsp; In addition, all pilots should master inflating their 
	gliders with the A's in one hand and the C's or D's in the other.&nbsp; You 
	may have to de-power your glider at any moment and this is the only way you 
	can safely do it while attempting a launch.&nbsp; Pulling deep on the brakes 
	does NOT de-power your glider!&nbsp; In addition, you will not have time to 
	go searching for the correct risers if things start to go wrong and you do 
	not have the correct ones in your hands.&nbsp; Jamming the brakes will only 
	make things worse.&nbsp; If you need training on how to do this, we can 
	help.</p>
	<h2>LZ location</h2>
	<p>32° 55.706'N&nbsp; 105° 56.722'W&nbsp; All are welcome to 
	visit our landing area in the city of Alamogordo at any time!&nbsp; To get 
	to the LZ: Turn east off of HWY 70 (also HWY 54 and White Sands Blvd.) on 
	Fairgrounds road, go straight past the Griggs Field ball park to the landing 
	zone on the left.</p>
	<h2>Directions</h2>
	<p> Directions to launch are available from any
	<a href="http://www.RGSA.info">RGSA</a> member (see Restrictions).</p>
	<h2>Restrictions</h2>
	<p>All pilots must contact the
	<a href="http://www.RGSA.info">RGSA</a> in order to fly this site. Only RGSA 
	members and their guests may use the site per rules set by the Lincoln 
	National Forest.&nbsp; First time pilots must be guided as the site has 
	hazards.</p>
	<p>Thermals&nbsp; DC has strong thermals that drift through the canyon and 
	often merge near the launch area  –  making them more powerful.&nbsp; Pilots 
	should be alert to turbulence when thermalling in this area, especially 
	during the summer, and be careful to launch in conditions appropriate to 
	their glider type and skill level.&nbsp; The house thermals are shown in the
	photo below.&nbsp; Pilots can expect 1,200'/min+ air in the middle of 
	the day during the late spring, summer, and early fall seasons and even 
	stronger rates near launch.&nbsp; The high pressure conditions that are 
	common in the region often make the thermals sharp edged (punchy).&nbsp; 
	Often tighter bank angles are required to stay in these narrower thermals. 
	(60 degree bank angle for PG or a 360 degree turn in 12 seconds time for 
	HG.)&nbsp; Unless you are comfortable and capable of handling glider 
	collapses, we generally recommend that PG pilots stay out of the air from 
	10:30AM-4:00PM from April until October.</p>
	<p>Launch Areas&nbsp; There are separate launch areas for PG and HG.&nbsp; 
	PG pilots should use the safer
	PG launch area 270 yd. southeast of the HG launch.&nbsp; The HG launch 
	is hazardous for PG for two reasons:&nbsp; 1.)
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAf1LKF5GeQ&amp;feature=player_embedded">
	Rotor and turbulence</a> are high because of the nearly shear cliff in
	front of the HG launch.&nbsp; 2.)&nbsp; There are many sharp rocks in 
	the HG launch area which tend to snag the lines, even cutting them on 
	occasion.&nbsp; We have put carpet all over the HG launch that helps 
	mitigate the sharp rocks.</p>
	<p>PG:&nbsp; Launch into the direction of the wind, turn left (HG launch) or 
	right (PG launch).&nbsp; Be sure to get out in front quickly.&nbsp; Keep a 
	healthy 50 yards between you and the rocks.&nbsp; While the HG launch adds 
	another 70' to launch altitude, it should not matter for PG.&nbsp; You will 
	get up if conditions warrant from either launch.</p>
	<p>HG:&nbsp; Conditions will determine which direction HG pilots will turn 
	when launching.&nbsp; Here is a good launch strategy (courtesy of Robin 
	Hastings): If you go UP off the concrete ramp, turn left. If you go down, or 
	straight out – turn right, and head for the LZ.</p>

	<p>For PG pilots Flying during the late fall and winter is the ideal time to 
	fly DC.&nbsp; Thermals are gentle and the ridge soaring conditions are 
	delightful.&nbsp; Pilots can fly the ridge all day and enjoy a glass off 
	above the city of Alamogordo.&nbsp; A dusting of snow can add to the 
	enchantment of flying Dry Canyon.</p>

	<h2>General Info</h2>
	<p>Top landing (PG only) has now been done a number of times and is safe if 
	the winds are not too high.&nbsp; Rotor is less than 10' from the launch 
	surface and does not matter.&nbsp; On October 9, 2011 Glenn Tupper of El 
	Paso was the first PPG (foot launched) to top land at the Dry Canyon launch.</p>
	<p>Being blown over the back is dangerous so pilots should always be 
	watching their speed over the ground.</p>
	<p>Always watch the clouds east of launch and do not launch if you see rain 
	falling west of the Cloudcroft ridge.&nbsp; Watch the weather while flying 
	and be prepared to land immediately if overdevelopment begins.&nbsp; Weather 
	dangers that are from the west can be observed by looking for the white 
	sands kicking up in the air.</p>
	<p>If you look carefully in the photo below, you can see the effects of high 
	winds on the Sands.&nbsp; They will kick up the white sands thousands of 
	feet in the air.&nbsp; Here, the sands have almost blocked the view of the 
	mountains behind them.&nbsp; IF YOU SEE ANYTHING LIKE THIS, DO NOT 
	LAUNCH/COME DOWN IMMEDIATELY as you are about to experience high winds.</p>
	<p>

	<p>Robin Hastings (HG) is an expert on the site and can be contacted by 
	email <a href="http://www.rgsa.info/contact-us/contact-us.htm">here</a> if you 
	have questions.&nbsp; Do not fly this site unless you have checked winds 
	aloft as an occasional northwest breeze can swirl around and come straight 
	in at launch but there will be rotor out in front, especially if you get 
	lower than the ridge.&nbsp; Conditions in the Tularosa Basin can be checked 
	by calling the automated weather service at the airport: 575-439-4112.</p>
	<p>LZ Info&nbsp; HG pilots can easily make the LZ in a sled ride from 
	launch.&nbsp; PG pilots, on the other hand, must have altitude greater than 
	the westerly part of the Dry Canyon ridge ("West Ridge") in order to make 
	the LZ.&nbsp; If you are lower, immediately turn southwest and find an LZ in 
	Dry Canyon somewhere south of the Space Museum. Inexperienced pilots should 
	not land on the dirt road just south of the Museum as there are hazards in 
	the area including light poles and fencing.&nbsp; Less experienced pilots 
	can safely use the dirt road that spans the Canyon from northeast to 
	southwest and goes downhill nearly all of the way.&nbsp; It is a hike out 
	but there is over a mile of downhill sloping dirt road that is easy and safe 
	to land on.&nbsp; Do not attempt to land on the dirt road that goes 
	northwest – southeast at the base of the canyon.&nbsp; It is intersected by 
	deep washouts that are hard to see and would be dangerous to land in.</p>

	<p>Below is a Google Earth image with path (green) to the PG launch area.&nbsp; 
	It is a short hike (270 yd.) around the back of the ridge and down a small 
	cliff.&nbsp; PG pilots can safely lay out their wing with little rotor or 
	turbulence and without the danger of snagging/cutting their lines.&nbsp; The 
	path is fairly obvious but is not well worn as only pilots use it.&nbsp; 
	(Our thanks to Bo Frazier of the Sandia Soaring Association for his help and 
	suggestions for using the PG launch.)</p>

	As evidenced here, the air coming in past the hang glider ramp can be 
	turbulent which is why we recommend that PG pilots do not use this launch.&nbsp;
