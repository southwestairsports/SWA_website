	<h1>North Mount Franklin </h1>
		<p>31° 54.175'N&nbsp; 106° 29.622'W&nbsp; 7,152'&nbsp; Rated H/P3 or 
		H/P2 with instructor present.</p>
	<p>View east (below) of the summit/launch of N. Mt. Franklin.&nbsp; The 
	launch is relatively free from rotor.&nbsp; The only obstacle that pilots 
	should be careful of is an amateur radio tower (visible below) that extends 
	about 15' above the flat (graded) peak.&nbsp; The road visible on the ground 
	to the east is the Patriot Freeway and is the west boundary of the Class C 
	airspace of El Paso International Airport.&nbsp; Always stay east of this 
	boundary.&nbsp; The airspace in the Park is all Class E which is good for us 
	up to 18,000'.&nbsp; Pilots should always keep a lookout for other aircraft. 
	Note:&nbsp; Please read the <a href="../Agave/agave.htm">Introduction to 
	Agave Hill</a> for important information.&nbsp; All pilots MUST be
	<a href="../Agave/registration.htm">registered</a> to fly any of the sites 
	in Franklin Mountains State Park</p>
	<p>Flyable with winds from the west counterclockwise to the east, according 
	to hang glider pilots.&nbsp; It is probably flyable with winds from any 
	direction as the summit is unobstructed.&nbsp; Best conditions are with a SW 
	to NW wind.</p>

	<h2>IMPORTANT NOTICE</h2>
	<p>Launching from the steep slopes and cliffs in the 
	desert mountains requires good kiting skills.&nbsp; It is hazardous to 
	inflate and then immediately turn before stabilizing your glider overhead 
	for a few seconds or more.&nbsp; Many pilots have damaged their equipment 
	and been banged-up attempting to launch in the often turbulent air that 
	characterizes the air we fly in.&nbsp; Pilots must have the skills to kite a 
	glider overhead under control before attempting a launch, especially in 
	strong air.&nbsp; In addition, all pilots should master inflating their 
	gliders with the A's in one hand and the C's or D's in the other.&nbsp; You 
	may have to de-power your glider at any moment and this is the only way you 
	can safely do it while attempting a launch.&nbsp; Pulling deep on the brakes 
	does NOT de-power your glider!&nbsp; In addition, you will not have time to 
	go searching for the correct risers if things start to go wrong and you do 
	not have the correct ones in your hands.&nbsp; Jamming the brakes will only 
	make things worse.&nbsp; If you need training on how to do this, we can 
	help.</p>
	<p>It requires a vigorous 2 hour hike from Tom Mays Park. The requirements 
	to launch from N. Mt. Franklin are the same as for Agave Hill.&nbsp; (For 
	detailed instructions on registering with the Park, go to the Agave Hill 
	Information site <a href="../Agave/agave.htm">here</a> and read the section 
	on Pilot Registration at the bottom of the page.)</p>
	<p>Launch is possible when winds aloft are calm (6k'-9K') because of 
	anabatic flow up the peak which creates a good updraft at launch (about 7 
	mph measured when winds aloft were calm). Winds at Mundy Gap (the high 
	mountain pass one mile north of the summit) proved to be about the same as 
	at the peak  –  both are very exposed and Mundy will experience some increase 
	in wind velocity because of a vortex through the gap.</p>
	<p>Winds aloft at 9K is about the same as at launch if the winds are in the 
	same direction at both 6K' and 9K'. This means that the maximum winds aloft 
	at 9K should be 12-16 mph for a safe launch for paragliding. </p>
	<p>There may be slight turbulence at launch in calm conditions because of 
	thermal activity. Ideal launch conditions for PG would be when wind is 10 
	mph at 240° at 9K.</p>
	<p>Benching to the top of the Franklins from Agave Hill is often a challenge 
	but it is an easy 15 minute hike to the Agave Hill launch.&nbsp; However, if 
	conditions are too mild or the wind direction is wrong, you will not be able 
	to bench and will have to do the hike.</p>
