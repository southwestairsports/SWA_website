	<h1>Black Mountain</h1>
		<p>Doña Ana County, New Mexico; launch&nbsp; 32.074719°&nbsp;-106.793906°, 
		4,390' MSL 60' AGL; rated H/P2<br><br>Black Mountain is an abandoned 
		pumice mine (1997) about (16) miles SSW of Las Cruces, NM.&nbsp; It is 
		also known as Little Black Mountain so as not to be confused with the 
		same in Catron County, New Mexico.&nbsp; It is not possible to launch 
		from Black Mountain itself but there are two smaller, sand covered, lava 
		hills just north and adjacent of the mountain.&nbsp; (The coordinates 
		and altitude above are for the most northerly hill or hill #2.)<br><br>
		The mountain is a strong thermal source, no matter what time of year.&nbsp; It has never 
		been flown by a hang glider to the knowledge of this writer.&nbsp; The 
		site is far away from the Rio Grande Valley and the quirky, 
		unpredictable winds that are customary for desert valleys.&nbsp; The air 
		at the top of hill #2 changes little from the winds aloft day or night.&nbsp; 
		Even our main training site, the Gardiner Turf Grass farms, experiences 
		the dramatic effects of the daily inversion that occurs in the Rio 
		Grande Valley.&nbsp; The site is free of hazards but a power-line 
		that follows Afton Rd. on the north side.&nbsp; There is no traffic in 
		the air or on the ground.&nbsp; It is unique as a flying site because it 
		can actually be flown with winds from any direction.&nbsp; The other 
		site that could be close to this feature is
		<a href="../MtRiley/MtRiley.htm">Mt. Riley</a> which is flyable from 0-240 degrees.<br><br>Why are we not 
		regularly training/flying at this site?&nbsp; If it were not 40 minutes 
		from El Paso/Las Cruces, we would....<br><br>PPG pilot, Max Bennett, 
		preparing to launch from a cleared area north of the mountain and just 
		south of W. Afton Rd.&nbsp; View is east.</p>

	<p>Hill #2 north of Black Mountain  –  view is north from the top and lower 
	hill #1.&nbsp; The black thing below is a cow  –  this is BLM property and 
	cattle roam freely.</p>

	<p>A view east from the summit of hill #2.&nbsp; The white stuff is snow 
	(it's too high to be an ocean beach with foam).&nbsp; The only hazard of the 
	site is mesquite bushes everywhere.&nbsp; Pilots have to avoid landing in 
	them  –  the stickers are sharp and the branches are a nightmare for glider 
	lines.&nbsp; If a pilot does not have good landing skills, he will quickly 
	acquire them flying in the open desert range of this region....</p>

	<p>Directions:&nbsp; Take Route 28 to W. Afton Rd. and go about 7 3/4 miles.&nbsp; 
	Turn left (south) on the dirt road and go about (2) miles to hill #2.&nbsp; 
	A good 4-wheel drive vehicle can easily make it to the top of the hill.</p>
