	<h1>Mt Riley, Dona Ana County, New Mexico</h1>
		<p>31° 55.551'N&nbsp; 107° 3.783'W 5,903' MSL Rated H/P2. &nbsp;Flyable with winds from south to north.&nbsp; These can be extended if conditions are light.</p>
	<p>
Visiting pilot, Jeroen Kusters, working a weak thermal northeast of 
	the peak in late December. </p>
	<p>
	<img alt="paragliding at Mt Riley, Dona Ana County, New Mexico" height="768" src="DSCN1750_01.JPG" width="1024">&nbsp;</p>
	<p>This is one of the prettiest and benign mountain sites for soaring and XC in the SW. The top is clear and smooth with neither obstructions, vegetation, nor rotor.&nbsp; Top landings are 
	possible.&nbsp; Launching is easy and safe as the top is a smooth cone all the way down.&nbsp; The southeast face has darker rock and is a good thermal generator.&nbsp; If flying other than with a 
	north to south wind, do not venture into the wind shadows created by Mt. Cox or Mt. No-name.&nbsp; Launching from Mt. Cox is possible but it is a much longer and more difficult climb as there are 
	no roads near its base.&nbsp; The top is about as good as Mt. Riley.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Here is a <a href="SkewT00Z311Nov2009.pdf">Skew-T of a balloon sounding</a> at Santa Teresa which illustrated a day when conditions at Mt Riley were good for soaring.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Denae Nemanic, the first woman to ever fly from the summit, heads out from the northwest face of Riley into buoyant air (she is already above launch).&nbsp; Mt. Cox is in the distance.&nbsp; 
	Winds were NW and light that day which made launching with such a huge object upwind of little concern.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Mt. Riley" src="IMG_5727.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>The site requires a 45 minute (1,000' vertical) hike to the top from the 
	southwest side.&nbsp; We plan to find a much lower launch site that will 
	allow benching to the top. Thermals are abundant, of course. XC is easy from 
	here.&nbsp; Ridge lift will take the pilot well above the summit and "jumps" 
	to the East Potrillo mountains should be easy where ridge soaring in 
	easterly or westerly winds are possible.&nbsp; The base of Mt. Riley is 
	accessible by 4 wheel drive only.&nbsp; This is a Federal Wilderness Study 
	Area and open range  –  be sure to watch for (and respect) the cattle that 
	are here and there.</p>
	<p>A guide is recommended for first time visitors.&nbsp; Contact us or the
	<a href="http://www.RGSA.info">RGSA</a> for directions.&nbsp; Visitors can 
	camp anywhere in this region but always respect the fragile desert 
	environment.</p>
	<p>Mt. Riley is the mountain in the middle. Mt. Cox is to the left and Mt. 
	No-name is to the right.&nbsp; The fence is the northern boundary of a ranch 
	that runs cattle in the area.</p>
	<p><img alt="Mt. Riley" src="DSC00384.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>Launch looking ESE.&nbsp; The two maars  –  Hunts (middle) and Kilbourne 
	(middle left) are just visible.&nbsp; The East Potrillo mountains are just 
	visible to the right. </p>
	<p><img alt="Mt. Riley" src="DSC00403.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>These (2) spots generate a lot of heat when the sun hits them and are 
	among the regular thermal sources of the area.&nbsp; House thermal #2 is a 
	small hill just 200 yd. wide at the base and 100 ft. high.&nbsp; Thermals 
	stream up from both of these areas continuously when the sun is directly 
	over them.&nbsp; #2 works better in the PM.&nbsp; #1 is good to about noon 
	and then goes into the shadows after that time.&nbsp; #1 can be a point of 
	air convergence during the afternoon if the wind is from the east so the 
	pilot is flying in both ridge and thermal lift at the same time.</p>

	<p>Had Robinson preparing to 
	launch from the summit. The view here is south with Mexico in the far 
	background.&nbsp; Mt. Riley is one of the few mountains that can be flown 
	from nearly any direction.&nbsp; In good conditions, a pilot can do cross 
	country or go "ridge jumping" as there are other soarable ridges nearby.</p>

	<p>The road to the base – 4 wheel drive only.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; Cell phone service out here is sporadic but better than years earlier.&nbsp; Some will work from the summit. </p>
