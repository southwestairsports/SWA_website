	<h1>Highway 9 Tow Area</h1>
		<p>31° 49.406'N&nbsp; 106° 41.128'W</p>
	<p><span class="bold">Notice: as of August 20, 2015 we will cease any 
	operations on Highway 9 until we obtain permission in writing to use the 
	highway by the Dona Ana County Sheriff (for the Dona County portion) and by the 
	New Mexico State Police (Luna County portion).&nbsp; For the last 7 
	years, we have had a 100% safety record and no complaints from Border Patrol 
	Agents, Sheriff Deputies, or State Police Officers.&nbsp; We have always yielded right-of-way to all 
	traffic and immediately pull off the road, as needed.&nbsp; However, a 
	new BP Agent saw me working on my equipment on the shoulder of the road and 
	asked what the equipment was about and I told them, giving him my card, and 
	he contacted the Sheriff and State Police raising a ruckus.&nbsp; If I had 
	said nothing, he would have gone on his way ... but I try to be helpful....&nbsp; 
	(We were <span class="auto-style1">not</span> towing nor even in the road.)&nbsp; I hope our 
	perfect safety record and that we provide training for those in the Armed 
	Forces will help us obtain the required permissions, shortly.&nbsp; Thank you for your patience. -- Hadi</span></p>
	<p>Hwy 9 is our best towing area in the region.&nbsp; The highway is over 55 miles long, 
	has long periods of zero traffic, with no bridges, intersections, crossings, 
	lights, or overhead power lines.&nbsp; This means we can safely tow forever 
	in either direction.&nbsp; In over 7 years of towing we have never had any 
	problems or accidents.</p>

	<p>Pilots launch on private land (we have permission) and then are towed up 
	from there along the highway.</p>

	<p>Pilots can tow up to about 10,000' MSL (over a mile above the ground) and 
	set out cross-country in any direction but south.&nbsp; (The US – Mexico 
	border is a couple of miles south of the highway.&nbsp; Landing there means 
	a LONG hike out  –  to the nearest border checkpoint with all of your 
	gear....)&nbsp; Most pilots should be able to hook thermals at 1,000' AGL 
	but it's fun to have multiple tries by going higher.&nbsp; Thermals will pop 
	off the road continuously during the day but the really big ones happen 
	every 15 -20 minutes or so and can be a mile or more apart.</p>
	<p>Below, active-duty Army pilot, Brad Gray, getting towed up to 9,000'+.&nbsp; He flew north to a cloud 
	street (to the right in the photo) and went west in the easterly winds 
	aloft, setting a regional XC record of 45 miles landing near Columbus, NM.&nbsp; 
	We only get a handful of days like this each year when conditions are 
	perfect for going a long distance.&nbsp; We cannot easily fly to the east 
	without getting into complicated airspace.</p>
	<p>When we tow, other road traffic only sees a slow moving truck with its 
	flashers on, that's it.&nbsp; The pilot is long gone and is invisible.</p>

	<p>Brad almost in the clouds in the cloud street that extended for at least 
	100 miles west of El Paso.&nbsp; Once in a cloud street, there is nothing 
	but lift as the thermals line up.&nbsp; This was an unbelievably good day 
	for XC here in our region.</p>
