	<h1>Polini clutch</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>The Polini clutch on the various models has the same overall design.&nbsp; It is a (3) part wet-type clutch.</p>
	<p>The clutch has an approximate maximum life of 200 hours.&nbsp; What wears out are not the surfaces of the clutch and bell housing but the metal 
	surfaces that hold the clutch shoes in place to the clutch hub.&nbsp; On the Thor 190 and 200, individual parts of the clutch may be replaced.&nbsp; On the 100 and 130 models, individual clutch 
	parts are not available.</p>
	<h2>Service</h2>
	<p>Service must be performed on schedule because the clutch runs in oil and particles from normal wear of the clutch face get trapped in the oil.&nbsp; If pilots notice that the oil is black when 
	changed it means that they are not changing the oil often enough.&nbsp; The <a href="../../thor130/specs130200.htm">specifications page</a> gives the correct type and schedule for changing the oil</p>
	<h2>Drag</h2>
	<p>If the clutch drags even slightly, it must be serviced immediately to discover why it is dragging.&nbsp; In the case of this type of clutch, drag is usually caused by one or more of the nuts 
	coming loose that hold the clutch shoes and springs to the clutch hub.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Polini does not use threadlock on important fasteners in 
	their engines and pilots are plagued with things coming apart at the most inconvenient times.</p>
	<h2>Clutch Service</h2>
	<p>Special tools are needed to service the clutch.&nbsp; Because Polini tools are not readily available in the U.S., pilots will have to improvise or make their own.&nbsp; In particular, you must 
	make a special bracket out of a flat piece of thin steel to hold the clutch when loosening and tightening the clutch nut.&nbsp; Unlike the Top 80, there is no other way to hold the clutch.</p>
	<p>1.&nbsp;Drain the oil from the clutch.&nbsp; Remove both the fill and bottom plugs.&nbsp; Pilots can cut the tip off an ordinary 4mm hex wrench to remove the drain plug so that they do not 
	have to remove the muffler assembly.&nbsp; It only takes a few minutes to remove the muffler assembly, however.</p>
	<p>2.&nbsp;Remove the propeller and hub.&nbsp; Remember that the bolt for the hub is reverse threaded!</p>
	<p>A sturdy oil filter wrench will hold the hub without damaging it.</p>
	<p><img alt="Polini Thor clutch disassembly" height="600" src="DSCN4374_01.JPG" width="800"></p>
	<p>3.&nbsp; Remove the (8) bolts that hold the outer half of the clutch casing.&nbsp; The lower (3) bolts are the shortest.&nbsp; The middle (2) bolts are the next longest and the (2) bolts just 
	above them are a bit longer.&nbsp; The very topmost bolt is the longest of the (8).</p>
	<p><img alt="Polini Thor clutch disassembly" height="600" src="DSCN4349_01.JPG" width="800"></p>
	<p>4.&nbsp;The outer casing should slip right off.&nbsp; If you are careful, you will not damage the gasket so it can be reused.</p>
	<p>There are tabs on the casing where a sturdy piece of steel plate can be inserted to GENTLY pry the casing off, if needed.&nbsp; It should NOT be forced off!&nbsp; If it does not come right off, 
	there may be corrosion on the propeller hub shaft that is holding it.&nbsp; Use some WD-40 to help.&nbsp; Whatever you do, do not pry on the face of the casing.&nbsp; If you do, it will leak!</p>

	<p>This clutch failed from one of the clutch shoes coming loose (clearly visible in the upper right of the photo below by the extra space between it and the other two shoes).&nbsp; The nut that held the shoe to 
	the clutch bracket did not have threadlock on it.&nbsp; It would be only a matter of time until the nut came off and the shoe touched the clutch bell -- and began to drag.&nbsp; Polini uses 
	locknuts but it is insufficient to hold in such a high stress environment.</p>
	<p><img alt="Polini Thor clutch disassembly" height="600" src="DSCN4353_01.JPG" width="800"></p>
	<p>5.&nbsp;Affix the special tool to the clutch and remove the nut.&nbsp; This tool is the only special one needed to service the clutch.</p>
	<p><img alt="Polini Thor clutch disassembly" height="600" src="DSCN4354_01.JPG" width="800"></p>
	<p>6.&nbsp;The entire clutch should easily slide off the shaft.&nbsp; If it does not, you may need a small gear puller.&nbsp; Keep close track of the orientation of the clutch and the special 
	tempered and flanged washer that goes under the nut.&nbsp; DO NOT LOSE THE WOODRUF KEY THAT SITS IN A SLOT ON THE DRIVE SHAFT!</p>
	<p>The clutch below required the correct sized puller to remove it from the engine shaft.&nbsp; The puller here is the official tool from Polini but it must be ordered from Italy.</p>
	<p><img alt="Polini Thor clutch disassembly" height="600" src="DSCN4355_01.JPG" width="800"></p>
	<p>7.&nbsp; Examine the clutch carefully.&nbsp; The nuts should be even with the ends of the studs coming out from the center of the clutch.&nbsp; If the faces of the clutch parts are damaged, 
	they must be replaced.&nbsp; On the Thor 190 and 200, individual parts of the clutch may be replaced but not on the 100 or 130 models.</p>
	<p>Here is a photo of the internal structure of the clutch.&nbsp; As the metallic parts of the shoe wear against the inner clutch hub, the force on the stud increases more and more, eventually 
	breaking it off the hub or bending it.&nbsp; In either case, the clutch will begin to drag at idle.</p>
	<p><img alt="Polini Thor clutch" height="600" src="DSCN4359_01.JPG" width="800"></p>
	<p>Below is a view of the loose (and now damaged) locknut that was supposed to hold the shoe to the clutch.</p>
	<p><img alt="Polini Thor clutch with defect" height="600" src="DSCN4356_01.JPG" width="800"></p>
	<p>The photo below shows the wear that the clutch experiences.&nbsp; The tempered steel spring grinds away over time at the metallic parts of the shoe.</p>
	<p><img alt="Polini Thor clutch wear" height="600" src="DSCN4365_01.JPG" width="800"></p>
	<p>8. If the clutch has been dragging and the nuts that hold the shoes in place are intact, the shoes or the entire clutch must be replaced.</p>
	<p>A properly assembled clutch.&nbsp; Note that the Polini logo and the rounded inner faces of the clutch shoes are on the same side.</p>
	<p><img alt="Polini Thor clutch assembly" height="600" src="DSCN4366_01.JPG" width="800"></p>
	<p>9.&nbsp;Even if the clutch looks in good condition and does not drag, it is a smart move to disassemble it, clean the parts with mineral spirits or brake cleaner, and reassemble it using RED 
	threadlock on the nuts and studs.&nbsp; This will insure that the most common point of failure with Polini clutches does not occur.</p>
	<p>10.&nbsp;Assembly of the clutch is the reverse.&nbsp; The clutch face that has the Polini logo faces the engine.&nbsp; Be CERTAIN that the convex side of the special washer faces the clutch.&nbsp; 
	This washer has two sides!</p>
	<p>If you get any of this mixed up, the clutch will drag.&nbsp; It is a good idea to be sure that the clutch moves freely before installing the outer case.</p>
	<p>Torque all nuts and bolts to specifications.&nbsp; Be extremely careful tightening the 6mm bolts that hold the casing on.&nbsp; It is very easy to strip the aluminum threads in the engine 
	crankcase.</p>
