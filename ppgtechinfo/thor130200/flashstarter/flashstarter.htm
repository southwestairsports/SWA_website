	<h1>Polini flash starter failure</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<h2>The problems</h2>
	<h3>1. flash system</h3>
	<p>The OEM starter on the Thor 130 (and others) has various problems and a short life because of design and material issues.&nbsp; Rather than have a durable starter (Top 80) and a 
	decompression hole near the top of the cylinder (Simonini), Polini came up with a scheme made of mostly plastic parts that fails after a few dozen starts.&nbsp; The intent, it seems, was 
	to reduce the effort necessary to start the engine.&nbsp; That any starter would have plastic parts is a mystery.&nbsp; It is an example of poor engineering to save a little money.</p>
	<p>When the mechanism starts to fail, parts of the flash mechanism begins to bulge out of 
	the starter housing and prevents the tangs from engaging the ring on the flywheel.&nbsp; 
	Eventually, the entire starter comes apart or the mechanism gets caught in 
	the flywheel and self-destructs.</p>
	<p><img alt="Polini Thor flash starter problem" height="480" src="DSCN1497_01_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>In this photo, the plastic strip that permits the flash spring to wind and unwind smoothly has bunched up and has begun to push the flash spring out of its housing.&nbsp; Did the engineers at 
	Polini ever take a look at this <a href="rube4_photo_gal_7696_photo_725597502.jpg">Rube Goldberg mechanism</a>?&nbsp; It seems that they copied some of its parts....</p>

	<h3>2. weak mounting structure</h3>
	<p>Pilots in the normal course of starting the engine may also pull the lower starter mounting bolt right out.&nbsp; Sometimes, the bolt will shear at the threaded end.</p>

	<p><img alt="Polini flash starter points of failure on the engine shroud" height="600" src="DSCN2923_01.jpg" width="800"></p>
	<p>Below is a photo of the Polini flash starter mount reinforcement.&nbsp; It helps prevent the twisting of the starter when it is pulled -- and the stripping/shearing of the existing bolts and 
	mounting points.&nbsp; However, it does nothing to prevent the disintegration of the flash mechanism.&nbsp; This part does not seem to be available at this time in the western hemisphere.&nbsp; If 
	the lower mounting bolt is replaced with our special bolt and locknut, the starter should not come loose as easily.&nbsp; So far, the modified flash starters on our engines have held steady 
	without the addition of this reinforcing plate.</p>

	<h3>3. starter cord</h3>
	<p>Generally, the OEM starter cords are too thin and lack sufficient strength.&nbsp; Please go to <a href="../../top80/hrservicenotes/StarterCord.htm">this page</a> for the discussion and a source 
	for a superior starter cord.</p>
	<h3>4. pulley failure</h3>
	<p>I do not know if other frame manufacturers (e.g. Parajet) use the same make and model of the Italian made starter pulley as Miniplane for their Polini engines.&nbsp; Hopefully, the answer is "no".&nbsp; The 
	Miniplane pulley is of poor quality and design.&nbsp; The OEM cord on the Polini starter can easily cut into the plastic of the rotating part of the pulley and render it useless.&nbsp; The pulley 
	uses nylon/plastic ball bearings which are guaranteed to fail after a short period.</p>
	<p>Below is a photo of the OEM pulley that was quickly destroyed by the starter cord on a Thor 130.</p>
	<p><img alt="Miniplane starter pulley showing how the cord can destroy it" src="DSCN1915_01.JPG"></p>
	<p>Replacing a failed OEM pulley is useless as it will just fail again, especially if the OEM starter cord is not replaced with a stronger, thicker cord.&nbsp; Determined pilots fed up with poor 
	quality parts from Miniplane can purchase the <a href="http://www.sailrite.com/Harken-Bullet-Block-Single#">Harken 082 Single Bullet Block</a> (shown below).&nbsp; It has a (5) year warranty and is superior in every way to the OEM block supplied by Miniplane.</p>
	<p><img alt="Harken 082 single bullet block" height="250" src="114280.jpg" width="250">&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Other than these annoying engineering problems, the Polini Thor engines 
	are lightweight, quiet, and powerful -- something desirable.&nbsp; In fact, the Polini's are among the quietest and smoothest 
	engines on the market.</p>
	<p>However, the flash starter problem makes these engines quickly unusable.</p>
	<h2>Solutions for these problems</h2>
	<p>We could bang our heads against a brick wall trying to convince the Italians to fix these problems but why waste the time?&nbsp; Because we love these engines, 
	even with these defects, we have come up with some fixes.</p>
	<h3>1. The insert for the flash mechanism</h3>
	<p>We have developed and manufactured a solid machined aluminum insert to replace the flash spring.&nbsp; It is easy to install.&nbsp; At the same time, the lower starter bolt must be replaced 
	with a better quality bolt.&nbsp; A locknut is needed to ensure that the bolt will not loosen.&nbsp; With or without the modification, this bolt and/or the embedded nut in the cooling shroud, will 
	eventually shear or the threads in the embedded nut will strip.</p>
	<p>Why not replace the starter with the Polini non-flash type starter?&nbsp; It is easy to do but the insert costs less.</p>
	<p>However, when this modification is made, more 
	strength is needed to start the engine.&nbsp; Most pilots will have to place the motor 
	on their backs and start it with both hands.&nbsp; This is easy if the engine is primed correctly.&nbsp; We have 
	developed a <a href="flashstarter.htm">technique</a> that allows any 
	engine with a diaphragm type carburetor to be started the first pull, every 
	time.&nbsp; No choke is used nor is it necessary.&nbsp; It works when the engine is hot or cold.&nbsp; It will not flood.</p>
	<p><span class="bold">Warning&nbsp; </span>THE POLINI STARTER -- EVEN WITH THE MODIFICATION -- IS DELICATE.&nbsp; DO 
	NOT YANK REPEATEDLY ON THE STARTER!&nbsp; THIS WILL DESTROY IT IN SHORT 
	ORDER.</p>
	<p>Here is a photo of the replacement for the Polini flash starter 
	mechanism.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="replacement for the Polini flash start mechanism" height="408" src="PoliniFlashReplacment-BW.jpg" width="544">&nbsp;</p>
	<p>This replacement kit is available from Miniplane-USA.&nbsp; Please go to this site and scroll down to purchase.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/parts/starter.htm">http://www.miniplane-usa.com/parts/starter.htm</a></p>
	<p>The kit includes the machined insert, a replacement bolt of better quality, and a locknut.&nbsp; Pilots must have good mechanical skills to remove and disassemble the starter in order to 
	replace the flash mechanism.</p>
	<p>If necessary, Southwest Airsports can supply and install the 
	kit for a nominal charge.&nbsp;
	<a href="../../../ContactUs/contactus.htm">Contact us</a> for more 
	information.</p>
	

	<p>Please be sure follow these <a href="insert.htm">
	instructions</a> for installing the flash starter replacement insert.</p>
	<h3>2. Improving the weak mounting structure</h3>
	<p>The most important modification is replacing the lower bolt with a tempered steel bolt and a locknut.&nbsp; This is included in the insert kit from Miniplane-USA.</p>
	<h3>3. Heavy duty starter cord</h3>
	<p>Use a Dyneema cord.&nbsp; It lasts forever and is designed for this sort of use.&nbsp; It is available from Miniplane-USA.&nbsp; Go here:
	<a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/parts/starter.htm">http://www.miniplane-usa.com/parts/starter.htm</a> and scroll down to "Top 80 Starter Cord, Dyneema 1.25m").&nbsp; It will also work in 
	other Polini Thor engines.</p>
	<h3>4. Better pulley</h3>
	<p>Harken pulleys are available everywhere in the world.&nbsp; Sailrite sells the <a href="http://www.sailrite.com/Harken-Bullet-Block-Single#">Harken 082 Single Bullet Block</a>.&nbsp; 
	Miniplane-USA may also have them soon.</p>
