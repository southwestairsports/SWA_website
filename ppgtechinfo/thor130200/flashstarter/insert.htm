	<h1>Polini flash starter insert manual</h1>
	<p>Note:&nbsp; Pilots who do not have good mechanical skills should 
	not attempt this job.&nbsp; Southwest Airsports can do it, if necessary.</p>
	<h2>Starter Parts</h2>
	<p>1 - main starter body with main spring and main insert<br>2 - flash 
	starter spring<br>3 - pawl holder and screw<br>4 - pawl springs<br>5 - pawls<br>
	6 - flash starter insert (original)</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Polini flash starter parts identification" height="480" src="DSCN3966_01.jpg" width="640"></p>
	<h2>Kit contents</h2>
	<p>(1) machined aluminum insert<br>(1) stainless steel screw 5mm x 0.8mm x 90mm and a 5mm locknut to replace the lower starter mounting screw</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="insert replacement for the Polini flash start mechanism" height="408" src="PoliniFlashReplacment-BW.jpg" width="544"></p>
	<p>The 
	replacement screw is necessary because Polini failed to account for the high 
	stress put on the original screw when the starter rope is pulled.&nbsp; The starter is, 
	effectively, only attached with (3) screws because the top screw attachment 
	point in the cooling shroud is -- in a word -- useless.&nbsp; This is 
	why the remaining (3) attachment points must have greater strength.&nbsp; 
	With the flash mechanism gone, the stress on the starter mounts is  
	greater and pilots MUST be careful to NOT ever yank on the starter!</p>
	<h2>Assembly Instructions</h2>
	<p>1.&nbsp; Remove the (2) 5mm bolts which attach the harness to the top of 
	the frame.&nbsp; Let the harness drop down enough to access the backrest 
	attached to the frame.</p>
	<p>2.&nbsp; Remove the backrest (this exposes the front of the engine).&nbsp; On some models, the backrest is attached with rivets which must be removed.&nbsp; They can be replaced with screws, if 
	desired.</p>
	<p>3.&nbsp; Detach the (2) starter rope pulleys from the frame.</p>
	<p>4.&nbsp; Remove the (4) starter mounting screws and the starter.&nbsp; It 
	is likely that the lower screw and/or nut insert is stripped.&nbsp; If the screw is intact, keep it as a spare.</p>
	<p>5. Disassemble the starter.</p>
	<blockquote>a.&nbsp; Remove the screw and pawl cover (#3)<br>b.&nbsp; Remove 
	the pawls (#5) and springs (#4) <br>c.&nbsp; Remove the flash insert 
	(#6)<br>d.&nbsp; Remove the flash spring (#2).&nbsp; The spring is not under tension and can be safely removed.&nbsp; DO NOT FURTHER DISASSEMBLE THE STARTER.</blockquote>
	<p>Here is the starter without the flash mechanism.&nbsp; Clean all grease 
	and debris out of the cavity that held the flash spring.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Polini Thor starter without the flash mechanism" height="480" src="DSCN3971_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>6. Assemble the starter with the flash insert replacement.&nbsp; DO NOT 
	USE ANY GREASE OR OIL WHEN REASSEMBLING THE STARTER.</p>
	<blockquote>a.&nbsp; Place the aluminum insert into the cavity that held the 
	flash spring.<br>b.&nbsp; Place the springs on the roll pins in the 
	aluminum insert<br>c.&nbsp; Place the pawls over the pins and 
	springs.<br>d.&nbsp; Replace the pawl cover and tighten the screw.&nbsp; Use 
	blue threadlock.&nbsp; Do NOT over-tighten the 5mm screw.&nbsp; It just 
	needs to be snug.</blockquote>
	<p>7.&nbsp; Test the modified starter by pulling the cord a few times.&nbsp; 
	The pawls should smoothly move out from under the pawl cover as the cord is 
	pulled and retract when the cord is released.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>8. Mount the starter on the engine.&nbsp; Use blue threadlock on all 
	screws.&nbsp; Replace the lower screw with the longer one, installing it like the other 
	screws.&nbsp; If the nut insert is stripped, it does not matter.&nbsp; Place 
	the locknut on the end of the new screw which will firmly secure this 
	mounting point.&nbsp; Be EXTREMELY careful to NOT over tighten the mounting 
	screws.&nbsp; They should be just snug -- 4-6 Nm is plenty.</p>
	<p>We 
	have discovered that workers at the Polini factory routinely strip the 
	starter screws and/or nuts during assembly so do not be surprised if 
	HeliCoils are needed.&nbsp; The are easy to install and are much stronger 
	than the original.&nbsp; I recommend that pilots do not bother to replace 
	engine parts that have stripped threaded inserts/holes but, instead, always use 
	HeliCoils, even if the engine is under warranty.&nbsp; This is because they 
	will just have the same problem again, sooner or later.&nbsp; It is the 
	price we pay for having one of the best paramotors on the market.&nbsp; 
	Hopefully, these annoyances will be fixed by Polini.&nbsp; 
	Meanwhile, consider how small the paramotor market is and how good the 
	Polini is, otherwise.</p>
	<p>9.&nbsp; Test the starter on the engine.&nbsp; I recommend getting into 
	the same position relative to the paramotor as if flying.&nbsp; Reach back 
	and pull gently on the starter until resistance is felt.&nbsp; Pull firmly 
	with both hands to be sure that the starter is operating correctly.&nbsp; If 
	so, continue with the next step.</p>
	<p><span class="italics">THE POLINI STARTER -- EVEN WITH THE MODIFICATION -- 
	IS DELICATE.&nbsp; DO NOT YANK REPEATEDLY ON THE STARTER!&nbsp; THIS WILL 
	DESTROY IT IN SHORT ORDER.</span></p>
	<p>10.&nbsp; Reassemble the back plate and harness.</p>
	<p>11.&nbsp; Prime the carburetor using
	<a href="../../top80/hrservicenotes/Starting/starting.htm">this technique</a>.&nbsp; 
	It is imperative that pilots ALWAYS use this method to start the engine as 
	it will minimize yanking and repeated pulling on the starter mechanism and 
	wearing it out.</p>
	<h2>Post Modification</h2>
	<p>Pilots must be careful not to pull too hard (yank) on the starter as it 
	is not sturdy, despite the presence of the insert.&nbsp; The 
	engine has high compression and is much harder to pull over without the 
	flash mechanism.&nbsp; It is suggested that it only be started with the 
	paramotor on the back using two hands.&nbsp; For pilots of average strength 
	and size, this is a much better and SAFER option.</p>
