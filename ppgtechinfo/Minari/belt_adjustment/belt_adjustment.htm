	<h1>Belt adjustment on the Minari and others</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>You know your belt is loose if the paramotor "chirps" at idle.&nbsp; This noise is caused by the sudden slipping of the engine 
	pulley and the belt.&nbsp; If the belt is loose, the paramotor will not achieve full thrust and the belt will wear out more quickly due to friction.&nbsp; If the belt is too tight, it will cause the 
	redrive bearing to heat up, including the belt, and this can cause both to fail.</p>
	<p>Always give the belt a quick check before use to be sure it is not frayed or about to fail.&nbsp; A belt failure is a disaster and will result in the engine quickly over-revving.&nbsp; This will cause the 
	engine to self-destruct.</p>
	<p>These steps will work on both the clutched and un-clutched versions of the Minari engine.</p>
	<p>DO NOT USE BELT DRESSING ON THE RE-DRIVE BELT.</p>
	<p>In the steps below, refer to the the <a href="../Minari_M9.pdf">Minari engine diagram</a> for parts identification.&nbsp; You will need:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>6mm Allen wrench (for the clamping screw)</li>
		<li>6mm x 3/8" drive hex bit (for the shaft concentric)</li>
		<li>3/8" click-type torque wrench</li>
		<li>WD-40</li>
		<li>3/8" beam type torque wrench (optional to verify belt tension on unclutched engines)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>1.&nbsp; Locate the re-drive shaft concentric part #82. It slides into part #24, the redrive housing.&nbsp; There is a slit in the housing above the concentric.&nbsp; Spray copious amount of 
	WD-40 into the slit so that the concentric can turn relatively easily.&nbsp; DO NOT USE OIL!&nbsp; The slit is right above the redrive shaft clamping screw (#26) which has the 6mm Allen wrench in 
	it (see photo below). </p>

	<p>2. Loosen the the redrive shaft clamping screw (#26) so that you can easily turn the re-drive shaft concentric (#82) with the hex bit or the Allen wrench.&nbsp; The re-drive shaft concentric is 
	accessible from the propeller side of the redrive, in the center of the propeller mount.</p>

	<p>3. With the 6mm hex bit and torque wrench, turn the concentric in such a way as to loosen the belt.&nbsp; Depending on how the belt was installed and tightened the concentric could have been 
	tightened CW or CCW.&nbsp; Once the concentric is loose, use the torque wrench to turn the concentric back and forth in order to be sure it moves freely.</p>
	<p>4. Set the torque wrench to 35 Nm (used belt) or 30 Nm (new belt).&nbsp; Begin to turn the concentric in a CW manner when facing the rear of the engine so that the belt just starts to get snug 
	on the pulleys.&nbsp; Turning the concentric in this direction will insure that the center bolt in the concentric is not inadvertently loosened.</p>
	<p>5. In the next step, be certain that the 6mm hex bit in FIRMLY and COMPLETELY inserted into the socket-head screw in the concentric.&nbsp; If it is not, it is possible to ruin the screw so it 
	cannot be removed.</p>
	<p>6. With one hand on the Allen wrench that is inserted into the clamping screw and the other hand on the torque wrench, turn the concentric until the torque wrench "clicks", carefully hold the 
	torque wrench in this position while tightening the clamping screw with the other hand.</p>

	<p>7. Tightening the concentric in this manner will give the correct tension of 27-30 Nm (used belt) or 23-25 NM (new belt) of torque before the drive pulley slips.&nbsp; If you have an 
	un-clutched version of this engine, you can use a beam-type torque wrench with the correct socket to start turning the drive pulley while holding the propeller.&nbsp; Note the torque value just as 
	the drive pulley begins to slip.&nbsp; In this way, you will be able to verify the correct belt tension done in step #6.</p>
	<p>8. Finish by tightening the clamping screw to 10 Nm.</p>
