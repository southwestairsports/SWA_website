	<h1>Propeller hub removal and installation</h1>
	<p>There may be times when the propeller hub will not easily come off the shaft.&nbsp; Whatever you do, DO NOT HIT IT WITH A HAMMER or PRY IT OFF!&nbsp; (That is, if you do not want to have to 
	rebuild the redrive.</p>
	<p>Because the hub is aluminum and shaft is hardened steel, it is an easy job to do but only if you have the right tools.&nbsp; You will need an ordinary gear puller and a propane torch.&nbsp; 
	WD-40 should be used to help soften things up for removal.</p>
	<p>1.&nbsp; If it is a particularly corroded hub, apply liberal amounts of WD-40 and let the whole thing sit overnight.</p>
	<p>2. Attach the gear puller as in the photo below and apply about 15 Nm of torque on the gear puller.&nbsp; Keep the center screw in the shaft as a convenient and safe place for the gear puller to 
	exert its force.&nbsp; If you are lucky, it might come right off.&nbsp; If it does not, <span class="bold">do not apply more force to the puller</span>.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>3. Use the torch at full power for about 30 seconds to heat the part of the hub near the shaft.&nbsp; Be very careful to to not get the flame near the base of the propeller shaft where the 
	neoprene seal is.&nbsp; As the hub 
	heats up, you may hear the aluminum expanding -- and breaking away from the shaft.&nbsp; Be patient.&nbsp; When you hear it go "clink" three or four times, apply force on the gear puller again.&nbsp; If you did it right, the hub should start to move.&nbsp; But as it cools, it may grip the shaft again you will have to apply more heat.&nbsp; DO NOT OVERHEAT THE HUB!&nbsp; It should not take 
	more than 30-50 seconds of heat before it breaks free.&nbsp; If you see the slightest bit of smoke, STOP IMMEDIATELY and let things cool down.</p>
	<p>4. To reinstall the hub, heat it with the torch full power for 15 seconds and then immediately put it on the shaft and drive it in with a dead-blow hammer.&nbsp; The hub has a tight fit and 
	must be installed with heat.&nbsp; If you do not get if fully seated, it will eventually loosen and the steel shaft will destroy the aluminum hub.</p>
	<p>The redrive here had been used in an ocean environment and the hub was badly corroded and firmly seized to the shaft.&nbsp; Proper application of heat allowed it to slip right off.</p>
