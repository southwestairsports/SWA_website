	<h1>Muffler springs</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Like the rubber engine mounts, the muffler springs serve an extremely important need.&nbsp; The vibration of two cycle paramotors is so severe that if it were not for the springs holding things 
	together, the vibration of the engine would quickly destroy the welded joints of the exhaust system.</p>
	<p>When the engine is running, it undergoes axial vibration at the same frequency as the revolution of the engine.&nbsp; The rotational movement of the engine can be 4mm-6mm near the engine 
	mounts.&nbsp; This high frequency movement is the source of the destructive forces that affect all parts of the paramotor, including the paramotor frame.&nbsp; This movement is similar to the 
	action of a hammer-drill used to cut through concrete.&nbsp; The further the distance engine parts are located from the center of the crankshaft, the greater the movement.&nbsp; It is easy to see 
	that the exhaust system (the manifold, the tuned pipe, and the muffler) is located the furthest from the crankshaft center.&nbsp; Consequently, it will undergo the greatest amount of movement.</p>
	<p>This is why there must be springs connecting things together or, like the manifold, the ability of the parts to rotate with respect to one another.</p>
	<h2>Spring installation</h2>
	<p>Use paraglider line to stretch the springs for replacement/removal.&nbsp; Do NOT use Vise-Grips or pliers to stretch the springs because this will nick the tempered surface of the spring connection 
	point and weaken it!&nbsp; Here is a video on <a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/tips/muffler_springs.htm">how to properly do it</a>.</p>
	<h2>Spring failure</h2>
	<p>Correctly manufactured springs that have been properly installed will last the life of the exhaust system.&nbsp; However, Miniplane and their Italian suppliers and manufacturers have 
	significant quality control issues that I and other pilots have long observed.&nbsp; As a result, we occasionally see batches of defective springs (and other engine parts) installed on new engines 
	that have a very short life.</p>
	<p>Below is a defective muffler spring from an almost new Top 80.&nbsp; It is easy to see that the manufacturer did not properly temper the spring.&nbsp; The point of failure was due to the steel 
	at the point of connection being brittle.&nbsp; The connection point of the spring cracked -- and failed.&nbsp; Naturally, Miniplane denies everything but to experienced machine shop guys, it is 
	obvious who is to blame.&nbsp; Pilots that experience muffler spring failure on engines with less than 300 hours, should contact their dealer and ask for replacements.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there 
	was a stretch of time when all of the springs had problems.&nbsp; Just keep getting replacement springs until you get ones that are correctly tempered.&nbsp; You will be happy to know that it is 
	nothing the pilots are doing that is causing failure of the springs.</p>
