	<h1>Finger Screw Modification</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>Having to replace 
	expensive screws in order to perform routine ignition, cooling fan, or starter service on 
	the Top 80 is a poor option.&nbsp; I have tried many ways to get an 
	end-wrench or a crow-foot on them in order to properly torque them down on 
	re-assembly but have not been successful.&nbsp; The clearances are just too 
	small.&nbsp; The result will always be that the screws are not tight enough 
	and the screws/pawl assembly will likely be bent/damaged.&nbsp; It is easy to loosen the screws but it is impossible to 
	reinstall them correctly so that the cooling fan will not move.</p>
	<p>Damaged finger screw (hex bolt) from an attempt to re-use finger screws without modifying them.</p>
	<p><img alt="damaged Top 80 finger screw" height="240" src="DSCN3874_01.JPG" width="320"></p>
	<p>A standard deep 
	socket must be used when re-installing the screws.&nbsp; The cooling fan spins at 9K+ RPM and the screws 
	must be properly torqued.</p>
	<p>Here is a permanent way 
	to be able to re-use the screws.&nbsp; Average mechanical skills and the knowledge 
	of how to drill and tap a hole are needed.&nbsp; Google the Internet 
	for detailed instructions on how to do this.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Miniplane Top 80 finger screw modification" src="DSCN0746_01.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
	<p>Needed Items</p>
	<p>Drill press, a Dremel type tool, and the following:</p>
	<p>1.
	m3 x .5 tap set (taper, plug, and bottom taps)&nbsp; These taps are small 
	and delicate so be careful when using them.<br><br>2. #44 drill bit or the metric equivalent<br><br>
	3. (3) m3 x 8mm screws</p>
	<p>Begin by using the Dremel to grind away the 
	peened tops of the screws down to the washer.&nbsp; <strong>Do not grind the washer!</strong>&nbsp; 
	Remove the washers by grabbing them with a pair of pliers and rocking them 
	off the tops of the screws.&nbsp; They will be re-used.&nbsp; Remove the pawls and the springs.&nbsp; 
	If you are not removing the cooling fan, just loosen (but don't remove) the 
	bolts.&nbsp; Remove the screws one at a time to do the mod.</p>
	<p>If the all of the screws are removed at the same time, the spacers 
	between the cooling fan and the flywheel (on some Top 80 models) may get 
	out of alignment.&nbsp; If 
	that happens, it will be difficult getting them all back in the 
	right position without taking off the cooling box.&nbsp; The 
	engine must be in the horizontal position on these models or the spacers 
	under the cooling fan will slide around.&nbsp; New models of the Top 80 have 
	the spacers attached to the cooling fan.</p>
	<p>Fortunately, the finger 
	screws are cone shaped at the pawl end so it is not difficult to center 
	drill the hole for the new screw.</p>
	<p>1.&nbsp; Make sure the washers will 
	fit over the end of the bolt and rest on the shoulder of the machined end.&nbsp; 
	You might have to take a small file to clean up the ends so that the washers 
	go on and off easily.<br><br>2.&nbsp; With the drill press, drill a hole in 
	the end of the screw about 10mm deep.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thread the hole (be sure to use cutting fluid). Clean with brake-cleaner &amp; air.&nbsp; The modified finger screws below can be re-used for the 
	life of the engine.</p>

	<p>If you do it right, the screw will bottom in 
	the hole and just snug the washer onto the shoulder near the end of the 
	bolt.&nbsp; Be certain to use blue thread-lock on the screws.&nbsp; 
	Reassemble the starter and test.&nbsp; Below is the finger screw, starter pawl, and spring detail.</p>

	<p>That's it!</p>
