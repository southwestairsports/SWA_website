	<h1>Replacing the propeller shaft seal without disassembly</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>As with automotive transmissions, replacing external seals without 
	having to tear the entire piece of equipment apart is always preferable.&nbsp; 
	The Miniplane prop seal is no different.&nbsp; Here is how to do it without 
	having to spend hours taking apart and then reassembling the redrive.&nbsp; 
	This technique is particularly important because the screws holding the redrive together can be difficult to remove  –  even with heat.&nbsp; Most 
	amateur mechanics will break them off or strip the top of the screw trying 
	to remove them.</p>
	<p>Be SURE to read these 
	instructions all the way through BEFORE beginning this project.</p>
	<h2>Supplies</h2>
	<p>Quality electric drill (a drill press is much easier to 
	use), 1/16" drill bit (or the metric equivalent), (1-2) #4 x 3/4" sheet metal 
	screws, 7/8" deep socket, blue threadlock, misc. 
	metric Allen wrenches, gear puller, masking tape, Vaseline, brake cleaner or 
	mineral spirits, Mobil One 75W-90 fully synthetic gear oil or 85W-140 gear oil.</p>
	<h2>Removing the seal</h2>
	<p>1.&nbsp;Remove the prop and flange from the shaft.&nbsp; You 
	will need a gear puller to get it off.&nbsp; If the flange will not move, maintain the pressure of the puller and then put a torch on it for about 45 seconds.&nbsp; The aluminum flange will expand and loosen the joint.&nbsp; 
	When this happens you will usually hear a "ping" sound which is your cue that the hub has loosened.&nbsp; WD-40 will also help stubborn 
	flanges.&nbsp; Drain the lubricant from the redrive.&nbsp; It is best to remove the redrive from the engine.</p>
	<p>2.&nbsp;Carefully wrap the shaft with multiple layers of 
	masking tape.&nbsp; This is CRITICAL.&nbsp; If you scratch the shaft with 
	the drill or a tool, the new seal will leak and you will likely have to replace the shaft.&nbsp; Make certain that the tape reaches down to 
	the top of the old seal itself.</p>

	<p>3. Take the 1/16" bit and SLOWLY (60 RPM max) drill a shallow hole in the side 
	of the old seal.&nbsp; You must use a quality electric drill as cheap ones 
	will not turn slowly enough.&nbsp; If you nick the casing, it's not the end 
	of the world as the new seal will have sealant enough to fix any nicks on 
	the casing.&nbsp; STOP the drill moment the drill starts to dig into the top 
	of the seal.&nbsp; That is, the moment the drill penetrates the metal just 
	beneath the&nbsp; rubber coating, it will act like a bolt in a nut and 
	quickly go in.&nbsp; You must know how to detect this.&nbsp; We are not 
	trying to make a round hole in the casing of the seal but just penetrate it 
	so we can put a screw in the hole.&nbsp; If you do it right, you will make 
	an opening in the metal but not go through the rubber on the other side.</p>
	<p>If you are unsure of how to do this, practice on a tin can or an old seal.&nbsp; This is the hardest thing to do and you don't want to make a mistake here.&nbsp; If you go too far, you will hit 
	the ball bearing that is underneath the seal and scar it.&nbsp; Thankfully, this bearing has a thin metal retainer protecting the balls and the race but it is still possible to get a drill bit 
	between the cracks and ruin the bearing.&nbsp; Take care not to contaminate the gear housing with metal chips.&nbsp; The seal in the housing below was jammed in hard.</p>

	<p>4. Take a #4 sheet 
	metal screw and carefully screw it about 1 1/2 turns into the hole you made.&nbsp; 
	YOU MUST USE A #4 SCREW AS A LARGER SIZE WILL NOT WORK.&nbsp; All the screw 
	has to do is hold against a steady and gentle pull.&nbsp; If you are 
	careful and the seal is not jammed in too hard, you may only need one screw to pull out the seal.&nbsp; 
	Use two screws if you cannot get it out with one screw.</p>

	<p>5. Next, remove 
	any steel flakes with a magnet.&nbsp; You do not want to contaminate the 
	gear case with steel chips!</p>

	<p>6. You can use a small block of wood and a 
	pair of wire cutters to grab the screw and GENTLY pull up the seal.&nbsp; Alternately, a pair of quality Vise-Grips can be used to grab the screw and a screwdriver used to push against the end of 
	the Vise-Grips, as below</p>
	<p>

	<p>If you do it 
	right, the seal will pop right out.&nbsp; If you can, do the last pry with 
	the shaft horizontal or facing a little down, you will eliminate the 
	possibility of junk falling back into the gear case.&nbsp; If the seal is 
	very tight and cannot be moved with one screw, drill a second hole and try 
	removing it from that side.&nbsp; You may have to pry a very little bit at a 
	time on each side to work it out.</p>
	<p>

	<p>
	7. Remove the masking 
	tape from the shaft.&nbsp; Note the old seal spring floating on the prop 
	shaft.&nbsp; This was caused when the seal was originally installed by Miniplane too 
	deeply into the shaft housing, causing the spring to separate from the seal.</p>
	<p>

	<p>
	<img alt="Replacing the propeller shaft seal without disassembly" src="DSC02987.JPG" width="448" height="336"></p>
	<p>8. After removing the old seal, clean out the old sealant (if there is any) on the casing 
	surface with brake cleaner or equivalent (mineral spirits will work but it 
	is not as good).&nbsp; To do this, stuff tissue paper down into the shaft 
	housing and then use a toothpick to scrape off the old sealant.&nbsp; It 
	will fall onto the tissue and then you can make the shaft horizontal&nbsp;and 
	pull out the tissue with the old sealant.&nbsp; If there is a speck or two 
	of sealant in the redrive, it won't matter.</p>
	<p>If you think you 
	contaminated the bearing or the redrive with debris, turn the engine so the 
	shaft is pointing down, put a few ounces of the proper gear oil in the redrive with a plastic pipe or syringe.&nbsp; Use compressed air on the fill 
	hole to blow the oil out through the bearing.&nbsp; Turn the shaft a few 
	turns while doing this.&nbsp; It makes a mess below the shaft but it will 
	thoroughly clean any debris out of the bearing.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Replacing the propeller shaft seal without disassembly" src="DSC02986.JPG" width="448" height="336"></p>
	<p>9. Use a cotton swap soaked with mineral spirits or brake cleaner (best) to thoroughly clean the seal housing. Use a dry swab to remove any solvent.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Replacing the propeller shaft seal without disassembly" src="DSC02993.JPG" width="448" height="336"></p>
	<p>10.&nbsp; Put a layer of masking tape around the 
	shaft.&nbsp; If you do not do this, the splines on the shaft may cut the 
	seal when it is pushed over them and cause a leak.&nbsp; The photo below 
	shows the top of the shaft exposed but it, too, should be wrapped in masking 
	tape.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Replacing the propeller shaft seal without disassembly" src="DSC02994.JPG" width="448" height="336"></p>
	<p>11. Coat the inside of the new seal and shaft with Vaseline.&nbsp; 
	This will keep the seal from burning up before oil reaches it.&nbsp; Be  
	careful not to get any Vaseline on the outside rim of the seal or on the 
	gear housing.</p>
	<p>

	<img alt="Replacing the propeller shaft seal without disassembly" src="DSC02997.JPG" width="448" height="336"></p>
	<p>12.&nbsp;Using a 7/8" deep socket (or the metric 
	equivalent), gently tap the seal down into the housing with a rubber mallet.&nbsp; 
	Note:&nbsp; Be EXTREMELY careful not to drive the seal in too far  –  it is 
	easy to do.&nbsp; If you have a drill press, use it to press the seal in 
	rather than driving it in with a mallet.<br>Note:&nbsp; Tap gently!&nbsp; 
	The seal will tend to go in crooked.&nbsp; You must move the socket to 
	the high side and tap/press it down.&nbsp; Take your time in doing this as 
	you do NOT want to drive the seal in past the housing surface.&nbsp; A 
	mistake here may require you to use a new seal and start over.</p>

	<img alt="Replacing the propeller shaft seal without disassembly" src="DSC03006.JPG" width="448" height="336"></p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Replacing the propeller shaft seal without disassembly" src="DSC03007.JPG" width="448" height="336"></p>
	<p>If you did it right, the new seal will be set even with 
	the bottom of the beveled edge of the housing.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Replacing the propeller shaft seal without disassembly" src="DSC03009.JPG" width="336" height="448"></p>
	<p>13.&nbsp; After you drive 
	the seal in, thoroughly de-grease the shaft and propeller flange.&nbsp; 
	Reassemble the flange to the shaft.&nbsp; Be sure to use blue thread locker 
	on the center bolt and torque it properly.</p>
	<p>14.&nbsp; Follow these <a href="../redriveoil/redriveoil.htm">instructions</a> for re-filling the redrive with the correct type and quantity of oil.</p>
