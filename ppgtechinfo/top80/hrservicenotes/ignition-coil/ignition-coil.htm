	<h1>Ignition coil</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>The ignition system on the Top 80 is both critical to its operation and 
	is the most difficult to service.&nbsp; Other paramotors have much more robust ignition systems that rarely need service.&nbsp; Precisely set timing and high spark voltage will ensure that the Top 80 has maximum power output.&nbsp; Fine adjustments here can also dramatically affect the life of the engine.&nbsp; Do not attempt to 
	<a href="../timing/timing.htm">time the engine</a> unless you have good mechanical skills.&nbsp; With $100 of easily available tools, pilots can <a href="../timing/check_timing.htm">check the 
	timing</a> of their engines.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>It is rare that the coil fails.&nbsp; Most of the time it is the secondary wire (the long thick wire that goes from the coil to the spark plug) that fails.&nbsp; Before continuing in this section, be certain that the secondary wire is not broken internally 
	or the coil is not shorted by <a href="../troubleshooting/elecltroubleshooting.htm">performing this test</a>.&nbsp; Page down to the "Secondary wire and coil test".&nbsp; If the coil is shorted internally or the secondary wire is 
	broken, it may still work at idle and low midrange but as soon as load is placed on the engine, the engine 
	will quit/fade.</p>
	<p>The inner carbon core of the secondary wire 
	eventually breaks from the severe vibrations of the engine.&nbsp; Over time (25-50 hours) the core burns back, forming an inner gap inside the wire which widens over time until the spark fails.&nbsp; At the same time, the internal voltages inside the coil increase and 
	it will eventually short out and fail -- but it is a slow process.&nbsp; The secondary wire <a href="../secondarywirereplacement/sec_repl.htm">can be replaced</a>, if necessary.&nbsp; If Miniplane used better quality wire, this frustrating problem would not occur.&nbsp; 
	As it, they use the cheapest "lawnmower" grade coil there is and pilots have this frustrating problem.</p>
	<p class="italics">Pilots should check the secondary wire 
	before going to all of the expense and trouble of replacing the coil.</p>
	<h2>Checking the coil Gap</h2>
	<p>Too great a coil gap will cause hard starting and slightly retard the spark.&nbsp; The Miniplane website specifies a gap of 0.3mm (0.12").&nbsp; However, IDM, the manufacturer of the coil and 
	flywheel, specifies a gap of 0.35mm - 0.45mm.&nbsp; The bottom line is that the gap could be from 0.30mm - 0.45mm.&nbsp; I recommend setting the gap closer to the minimum because the engine will 
	start more easily.&nbsp; If the gap needs to be changed, see "Replacing the coil or changing the gap" at the end of this article.</p>
	<p>Do not waste time checking the coil if the fuel system has not been <a href="../fuelsystemtest.htm">checked</a> FIRST.&nbsp; Note: missing in the midrange is caused by too small a notch in the throttle plate which makes a 
	rich mixture from 1/3 - 2/3 throttle.&nbsp; It can be <a href="../walbrowg8/GerryFarellmods.pdf">
	modified</a>.&nbsp; It is an annoying engineering defect in the WG-8 carburetor which is particularly noticeable flying above 5,000' MSL.</p>
	<p>Checking the coil gap can be done without 
	disassembling the engine.&nbsp; However, a feeler gauge with a narrow blade must be used.&nbsp; Ordinary feeler gauges will not fit in the tight space between 
	the coil and the engine.</p>

	<p><img alt="checking the coil gap on the Top 80 engine" height="480" src="DSCN3860_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>As the 
	gap increases, the voltage output of the coil decreases (but only at low RPM) and the spark timing 
	advances (fires later).&nbsp; Pilots will want the 
	gap to be exactly as specified for maximum spark output when starting the engine and for the correct 
	timing.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>The coil has two points where the gap must be checked between them and the flywheel (see photo below).&nbsp; The gap specified is the minimum between any part of the coil and the flywheel.&nbsp; 
	Note the orientation of the coil -- the secondary wire is up.&nbsp; If it is installed upside down, the coil will not work.</p>

	<h2 id="Replacing_the_coil_or_changing_the_gap">Replacing the coil or changing the gap</h2>
	<p>Do not attempt this procedure unless you have a set of new finger screws or have <a href="../finger-screw-mod/finger-screw-mod.htm">modified them</a>.&nbsp; An alternative to replacing the coil 
	is <a href="../secondarywirereplacement/sec_repl.htm">replacing the secondary wire</a> which is almost always the faulty part of the ignition.</p>
	<p>This is the most difficult routine service procedure with the Top 80 engine.&nbsp; Note: Miniplane has been supplying some coils that have one or both mounting holes machined about .003" off so that the coil gap cannot be set correctly.&nbsp; This can be easily fixed by enlarging the holes slightly with a tool grinder towards the outside of the coil.&nbsp; Do not drill the holes because it is easy to short out the coil sheaves and ruin the coil.&nbsp; 
	Pilots need to remember that these IDM coils are "scooter" or "lawnmower" quality.&nbsp; Hopefully, Miniplane might someday specify a decent coil that will last the life of the engine.</p>
	<p>Begin by removing 
	the engine from the frame and completely disassembling the front of the 
	engine.&nbsp; Remove the cooling box (cowling), the cooling fan, and the coil.&nbsp; Use an 11/64" drill bit to carefully drill out the rivet head that holds the primary coil wire to the cooling 
	box.&nbsp; Do it just enough so that the head of the rivet is removed.&nbsp; Do NOT continue to drill the actual rivet that is in the cooling box.&nbsp; Once the head of the rivet is removed, the 
	clip and wire will pop off.&nbsp; Use a 1/8" punch (or equivalent) to punch out the rivet that is in the cowling.&nbsp; The new rivet that you will use is a size 1/8" medium aluminum.<br><br>Unless 
	<a href="../finger-screw-mod/finger-screw-mod.htm">modified finger screws</a> 
	are used, it will be necessary to grind down the ends in order to remove them.&nbsp; Some have managed to loosen and remove the finger 
	screws by getting a thin end-wrench on them.&nbsp; However, it is impossible to torque the screws to the correct value during re-installation without removing the pawls and springs.&nbsp; Some pilots claim to be able to re-install the finger screws with the pawls and springs attached -- but they invariably bend the springs and/or the spring stops and/or wreck the screws.&nbsp; If the cooling fan is not torqued down properly it can move enough to cause vibration at high engine speeds.</p>

	<p><img alt="damaged Top 80 finger screw" height="240" src="DSCN3877_01.JPG" width="320">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt="damaged Top 80 finger screw" height="240" src="DSCN3874_01.JPG" width="320"></p>
	<p>Put the fiber washers on the coil mounting surfaces on the crankcase.&nbsp; If you use the old washers, align them carefully so that the machined surfaces on the crankcase and imprints on the 
	washers line up.&nbsp; Use a small dab of rubber cement or RTV sealant to hold them in place.&nbsp; In the washer are misaligned it may change the alignment of the coil with the flywheel and the 
	gap will not be uniform.</p>
	<p>Attach the new coil with the secondary wire towards the top of the engine.&nbsp; Hand tighten the screws.&nbsp; Threadlock is not needed on these screws.&nbsp; The coil must be installed with the secondary wire towards the top of the engine.&nbsp; 
	If it is installed with the secondary wire oriented towards the bottom of the engine, the coil will not work.&nbsp; Note: the <a href="../partsdiagrams/engine.jpg">Mecafly illustration</a> shows 
	the coil installed incorrectly. </p>
	<p>In order to adjust the gap correctly, two feeler gauges must be used.&nbsp; This is because the coil 
	will rotate on one screw when the gap is adjusted on the opposite side.&nbsp; 
	The slight rotation of the coil when it is moved to adjust the gap on one side will affect the other side.</p>
	<p>Place a gauge 
	between each end of the coil and the flywheel at the location 
	shown here.</p>
	<p><img alt="Top 80 ignition coil showing points for gap measurement" height="480" src="DSCN1877_01_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>Push the coil firmly against the 
	gauges and snug up the mounting screws by to a (1) Nm or less.&nbsp; Check the gaps again to 
	be sure they are correct.&nbsp; If all is OK, tighten the screws to the 
	correct torque (4-5 Nm).</p>
	<p>If the gap is too great, the engine can miss at high loads because 
	the spark is not strong enough.&nbsp; If the gap is too small, there is the 
	risk that the coil and flywheel might touch as the flywheel heats up and 
	expands when the engine is run.&nbsp; If they touch, the coil will be ruined from shorting the iron sheaves..</p>
	<p>The
	<a href="http://www.miniplane.com/manuale%20miniplane/controlli%20&%20manutenzione/MANUTENZIONE%20PROFESSIONALE/manutprof.htm">
	Miniplane service site</a> ("accensione ignition" section) has some photos of the coil and where the gap should be measured if the above photo is unclear.</p>
	<p>After the coil is gapped correctly, the <a href="../timing/check_timing.htm">ignition timing</a> can be checked (optional) and <a href="../timing/timing.htm">re-timed</a>, if necessary.<br></p>
