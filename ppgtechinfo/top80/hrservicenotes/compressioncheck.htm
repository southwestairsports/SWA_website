	<h1>Engine compression check</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>If you want trouble-free operation, you must keep track of the compression of 
	your engine on a regular basis.&nbsp; It's like going to the doctor.&nbsp; Regular checkups can save your life -- including keeping your paramotor purring for 100's of hours.</p>
	<p>Checking the compression will give you the best evaluation there is of your engine's overall mechanical condition.</p>
	<p>You must use a good quality compression tester that screws into 
	the cylinder head.&nbsp; Note that if you use a different tester each time 
	you check your compression, you will get different values so always use the 
	same one.&nbsp; Carefully follow the directions that came with your tester.&nbsp; 
	The values you get will be different for a cold or a warmed up engine.</p>
	<p>The compression should be about 135 psi (4,000' MSL) or 150 psi (sea 
	level) for engines with a 10:1 compression ratio, like the Top 80.&nbsp; For other engines go to the respective <a href="../../ppgtechinfo.htm">specification page</a> for the compression ratio and 
	multiply this by 15 to give the approximate compression value.&nbsp; The exact value will 
	vary depending on altitude, type of compression tester, or whether it is a 
	cold or hot engine.&nbsp; Engines that have a decompression hole like the Minari and Simonini will have much lower values.</p>
	<p>If the compression is less than 90% of the correct value, replace the cylinder, piston, and ring.&nbsp; Miniplane-USA sells a kit that includes these parts.&nbsp; Pilots can also have their 
	cylinders re-bored at <a href="http://www.rb-designs.com/rb_designs_llc_007.htm">this shop</a> for a modest price and get an oversized piston from Miniplane-USA.</p>
	<p>A compression check will not tell you what 
	condition your engine bearings are in.&nbsp; The bearing that wears the 
	fastest is the upper connecting rod bearing (a.k.a. the piston roller-cage 
	bearing).&nbsp; Pilots can check for general bearing wear by listening 
	closely to the engine while it is running at medium or slow speeds.&nbsp; 
	Any knocking sound (like hitting a piece of metal with a hammer) must be 
	checked out immediately.&nbsp; An easy way to get some idea of the shape of 
	all the bearings is to remove the clutch housing, grasp the crankshaft (the 
	clutch), and turn it back and fourth a bit.&nbsp; There should not be any 
	play or very little (&lt; 1mm) in the crankshaft in any direction before the 
	piston begins to move up or down.</p>
	<p>WARNING: When bearings start to 
	fail, they will do so quickly and this can destroy an otherwise perfectly 
	good engine.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Replacing the upper connecting rod bearing is 
	supposed to be done every hundred hours (Miniplane's recommendation).&nbsp; 
	I have found that this bearing will last much longer than a hundred hours.&nbsp; 
	However, it is an inexpensive job to replace it compared to replacing the engine if 
	the connecting rod should fail at the bearing.&nbsp; I attribute the long 
	life of this bearing in my engines due to the fact that I use the best 
	fuels and oils I can buy and do not run my engines at full throttle but for 
	only brief periods (&lt;2 or 3 minutes).</p>
	<p>When you replace this bearing, 
	also carefully check the <a href="clutch/clutch.htm">clutch connectors and springs</a> for wear.</p>
	<p>Remember that idling a paramotor for more than a few minutes at a time will 
	wear out clutch parts prematurely and foul your spark plug.</p>
	<p>If you 
	fly in a dusty place or like doing foot-drags in sandy locations (e.g. the beach), expect 
	dramatically increased wear in your engine top end.&nbsp; It is almost impossible to 
	keep sand out of an engine if you launch from a beach.</p>
