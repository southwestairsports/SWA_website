		<font size="5">Throttle Spring Replacement -- Top 80 
		Engine</font><p>(removed from site 6-20-14)</p>
		<p>by Had Robinson</p>
		<p>An annoying problem with the main throttle return spring on the Top 
		80 is its tendency to break after extended flying time.&nbsp; In an 
		earlier article, I lengthened the tab connected to the throttle shaft so 
		the return spring will have greater leverage but put less pressure on 
		the bearing surfaces of the throttle shaft.&nbsp; The throttle shaft is 
		not enclosed by quality bushings but just the soft metal that the 
		carburetor is cast from.<br>
		<br>
		The net result of this modification after hundreds of flying hours was 
		not a reduction in the wear of the throttle shaft bore -- wear was about 
		the same.&nbsp; The big advantage was that I never experienced another 
		throttle return spring failure.&nbsp; Such failures could be dangerous 
		-- a sudden run-away paramotor.&nbsp; Extending the existing tab of the 
		throttle shaft (see below) 
		is optional.&nbsp; If you do, it will greatly increase the return spring 
		pressure.<br>
		<br>
		If your throttle cable tends 
		to stick, go to your local bike shop and purchase a Teflon coated cable.&nbsp; 
		For less than $10, you can have near new functionality of the throttle 
		system.&nbsp; This replacement will last 50 - 100 hours.&nbsp; When replacing the 
		cable, be sure to thoroughly clean every trace of debris, grease, and 
		oil from cable housing.&nbsp; Do NOT use any lubricant but pure graphite 
		to lubricate the cable.&nbsp; Everything else attracts dust and grime 
		which will eventually cause the cable to seize.&nbsp; Over time, the 
		Teflon coating of the cable wears off and the little pieces can jam the 
		cable.<br>
		<br>
		If you fly in cold weather, have a left handed throttle installation, or 
		have any dust in your throttle cable, you will have experienced problems 
		with the throttle returning quickly and firmly to idle.&nbsp; Furthermore, the small size of 
		the original spring results in overstretch and 
		frequent breakage of the spring -- something that borders on a major 
		hazard when flying.&nbsp; <br>
		<br>
		The 
		replacement spring is a high quality automotive-type return spring that does the job.&nbsp; 
		If you decide to lengthen the throttle tab, the one here overlays the old so that none 
		of the original parts of 
		the carburetor need to be modified.</p>
		<p>Below, the original screw that holds the spring to the engine case 
		and the spring.&nbsp; The original spring had broken after less than 10 hours in 
		flight.&nbsp; It was likely a defective spring.&nbsp; Replacing it with a new factory spring (if you can find 
		one) does not 
		fix the problem.&nbsp; Note the distortion of the original throttle 
		spring (photo below) caused by sharp bending around the throttle plate shaft.<br>

		<p>Parts needed:</p>
		<p>(1) Automotive throttle return spring - these springs have an 
		attachment loop at one end.&nbsp; The other end of the spring is just a 
		long straight piece of wire so the spring can be attached in a variety of ways.&nbsp; These are 
		available at any auto parts store.&nbsp; The spring here is 
		approximately 9mm wide by 50mm long.&nbsp; Get the thinnest spring you 
		can find.&nbsp; Your new spring is superior to the 
		original.&nbsp; </p>
		<p>(1) Piece of thin steel (1/16th&quot; thick X approx. 1&quot; long X 1/4&quot; wide) 
		for the longer tab.&nbsp; Cut the tab from a lumber support strap available 
		in a building supply store, like Lowe's.</p>
		<p>(1) Very small bolt and nut that will fit through both the original 
		and new tab, connecting them together.&nbsp; This is hard to find.&nbsp; 
		The bolt is less than 1 mm in diameter.&nbsp; An electronics supply firm 
		may have it or a local bolt and screw company.&nbsp; If you must, you 
		may drill a much larger hole in the original tab to fit the bolt you 
		have.</p>
		<p>(1) Short piece of polyethylene or rubber tubing (1/4&quot; OD or 
		less) to protect 
		the long end of the spring from wear on the engine casing.</p>
		<p>Using a Dremel tool or equivalent, cut out the new tab to the size 
		and shape here (about 1/4&quot; x 1&quot;).&nbsp; You must drill (3) holes in the 
		tab.&nbsp; One must be just big enough to allow the new tab to fit over 
		the mounting screw for the original tab.&nbsp; The second hole is the 
		same size as the hole on the original tab used for attaching the 
		original spring.&nbsp; It must be carefully matched 
		so that the new tab can be attached to the top of the old.&nbsp; Be SURE 
		to use thread locking compound on the tiny bolt and nut!&nbsp; The third 
		hole is for attaching the new throttle return spring.&nbsp; Be SURE to 
		smooth the edges of the third hole as the steel spring will prematurely 
		break at this point if you do not round the edges of this hole!&nbsp; 
		Study the photos below carefully before you begin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>When completed, the new throttle will have a more secure return to 
		the idle position because of the additional leverage on the throttle 
		shaft with no increase of pressure on the throttle shaft bore.&nbsp; The 
		new spring should last the life of the engine.</p>
		<p>The throttle in the photo below is in the idle position.&nbsp; Note how the factory 
		supplied throttle return spring fits nicely 
		over the old and new tab (just to the lower right of the throttle plate 
		shaft screw.</p>
		<p>
		<img border="0" src="DSC00992.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>The choke cable must be flipped over so that the new tab will clear 
		it when it is in the full throttle position.&nbsp; It is a very close 
		clearance.</p>
		<p>

		<p>The throttle in the fully extended position.&nbsp; Note the tight 
		clearance to the choke cable.</p>
		<p>
		<img border="0" src="DSC01002.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
		<p>A very fine hole must be drilled through a tab that sticks out of the 
		engine case on the left side.&nbsp; It must be just big enough for the 
		spring wire to fit.&nbsp; If you make the hole too big, it may weaken 
		the structural strength of the tab.&nbsp; Pull the straight end of the 
		spring through the hole so that the new throttle spring is extended 
		about 1/2&quot; or so.&nbsp; Using a pair of needle nosed pliers, bend up the 
		spring wire so that it will be secure.&nbsp; The tubing shown must be in 
		place to prevent vibration from the engine causing the spring wire to 
		wear a groove in the engine casing and perhaps causing a premature 
		failure of the new spring.</p>
		<p>

		Be sure to thoroughly test your new spring installation before flying 
		your Top 80.<p>
