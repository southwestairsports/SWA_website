	<h1>Throttle Spring Modification  –  Top 80 Engine and Others</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>An annoying problem with the main throttle return spring on the Top 80 is 
	its tendency to break at any time. The stock throttle 
	return spring system also puts unnecessary wear on the throttle shaft bores, 
	wearing them out long before the engine wears out.&nbsp; Here is a way to 
	permanently fix the problem for less than $1 and in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; 
	An added bonus is that this modification is very unlikely to break or fail 
	like the OEM setup.<br><br>First check to see if your throttle 
	cable tends to stick.&nbsp; If so, go to the
	<a href="../throttlecable/throttle-cable-assembly.htm#Cleaning_the_Throttle_Cable">throttle cable</a> 
	section for instructions on how to correctly clean it.&nbsp; Do not make 
	this modification unless your throttle cable moves freely and smoothly.&nbsp; 
	You may have to replace the cable or the sheath or both.<br><br>If you fly in cold weather, have a left handed 
	throttle installation, or have any dust in your throttle cable, you will 
	have experienced problems with the throttle returning quickly and firmly to 
	idle.&nbsp; Furthermore, the small size of the original spring results in 
	overstretch and frequent breakage of the spring.&nbsp; <br><br>Below, the 
	original screw and throttle return spring.&nbsp; 
	The original spring had broken after less than ten hours in flight.&nbsp; 
	Was it a defective spring?&nbsp; Replacing it with a new factory spring does 
	not fix the design problem.&nbsp; Note the distortion of the original 
	throttle spring (photo below) caused by sharp bending around the throttle 
	plate shaft.</p>
	<p>

	<p>This fix that will give a more 
	positive return of the throttle to idle.&nbsp; Additionally, heavy users of 
	the Top 80 will note that throttle shaft wear in the bushings is greatly 
	reduced, extending the life of the carburetor.</p>
	<h2>Parts needed</h2>
	<p>(2) 
	compression springs 7/32" x 1-1/2" or (1) compression spring 7/32" x 3".&nbsp; These are available at most 
	hardware stores including Harbor Freight.</p>
	<h2>Modification</h2>
	<p>1.&nbsp; Remove the original throttle spring on top of the carburetor 
	that goes from the throttle shaft tab to the crankcase.&nbsp; Do NOT remove 
	the secondary throttle shaft return spring (arrows) that is located under the tab.&nbsp; 
	In case of a failure of the throttle cable, there must be some mechanism to 
	close the throttle.</p>

	original spring. </p>

	<p>2.&nbsp; Carefully remove the knarp (cable stop nut) from 
	the throttle cable at the base of the carburetor.&nbsp; Pull the throttle 
	cable out of the tab on the throttle shaft.<br><br>3.&nbsp; Place the  
	compression spring(s) on the throttle cable.&nbsp; Optional: A 1/2" long piece of 1/4" ID copper tubing can be split and placed around the spring and ferrule to help keep the throttle cable from 
	rubbing against the spring.<br><br>4.&nbsp; Re-connect the 
	throttle cable to the throttle shaft.&nbsp; You're done!<br><br>This modification ensures that the throttle cable fully returns the 
	throttle to the idle position.&nbsp; Note that the exact details of your 
	throttle shaft tab may be different.&nbsp; Pilots may also want to change how 
	the throttle cable attaches to the throttle shaft tab.&nbsp; The 
	<a href="../throttlecable/throttle-cable-assembly.htm">modification</a> below puts the wear point on a small cotter pin rather than 
	on the strands of the cable.&nbsp; This will extend the life of the throttle 
	cable to the maximum, especially if you have one that is Teflon coated.&nbsp; 
	It will also give smoother throttle operation.</p>

	<p>Be sure to thoroughly test your new spring installation before 
	flying your Top 80.&nbsp;</p>
