	<p>It is best to use a semi-synthetic 2 stroke oil with ethanol gasoline blends -- see below.</p>
	<h2>GASOLINE</h2>
	<p>Miniplane recommends<sup>1</sup> premium unleaded (ethanol free) gasoline for the 
	Top 80, Polini Thor, and Minari models.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it is getting increasingly more difficult to find gasoline that is free of ethanol unless you live outside of Europe and North America.&nbsp; 
	Ethanol is the source of serious problems for the fuel systems in high performance two stroke engines and should be avoided, if possible (see the below for more detailed information on this).&nbsp; 
	Thankfully aviation gasoline (AVGAS) is still available world-wide and can be used in any two stroke engine.&nbsp; Only use fuel containing ethanol if no other type of gasoline 
	is available and then according to the instructions given below.</p>
	<h3>
	Premium gasoline ONLY</h3>
	<p>
	Miniplane recommends premium fuel because of its higher quality rather than its 
	higher octane value.&nbsp; Automotive gasoline that contains ethanol should only be purchased from 
	a major company, like Chevron or Shell, because their fuels contain 
	important additives, especially detergents, that lessen the buildup of 
	carbon inside the cylinder and gunk in the fuel system caused by the presence of ethanol.&nbsp; Lesser grades of fuel can be used but they note that you may have higher running temperatures of the engine 
	i.e. you may overheat your engine at higher loads and experience damage.</p>
	<h3>
	Use of poor quality fuel</h3>
	<p>
	If you must use low octane/poor quality fuel, increase the 
	thickness of the washer under the spark plug which lowers the compression ratio of the engine.&nbsp; The latter can be 
	quickly and easily done by adding a second washer to the existing one that is on a used spark plug.&nbsp; If you get too much spacing, you will not harm anything except lower the engine output.&nbsp; Spark 
	plug spacer washers (2mm) are 
	available from <a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/parts/ignition.htm">
	Miniplane-USA</a>.</p>
	<h3>
	Winter vs. summer gasoline formulas</h3>
	<p>
	It is important for pilots to note that automotive service station 
	gasoline is formulated differently for the cold and hot seasons of the year.&nbsp; 
	We have learned -- the hard way -- that gasoline refined during the winter 
	months has serious problems with vapor lock when used in hot weather.&nbsp; 
	That is, the fuel may turn to "fizz" inside the fuel system and cause vapor lock.&nbsp; 
	This will starve the engine of fuel and can cause lean-out under high loads 
	which can damage the engine.&nbsp; 
	If pilots store gasoline for long periods, do not use fuel 
	refined in winter for use in the summer.&nbsp; It does not matter whether 
	fuel preservative is used or not.&nbsp; Aviation gasoline (AVGAS), on the 
	other hand, rarely has issues with vapor lock because of its higher boiling point.&nbsp; Note that most paramotors use a vacuum to pump fuel from the tank to the carburetor unlike other 
	aircraft.&nbsp; This creates a low pressure on the fuel and it is easier for the fuel to reach its boiling point -- and fizz.</p>
	<h3>Gasoline with ethanol</h3>
	<p>
	If there is any way to use fuel without ethanol, do so.&nbsp; If not, take 
	note of the important precautions 
	below. </p>
	<p>
	<a href="http://www.rotaxservice.com/rotax_tips/rotax_feed2.htm">ROTAX</a> 
	warns that their engines will experience damage with ethanol fuel blends 
	greater than 5%.&nbsp; This warning from ROTAX should alert paramotor pilots 
	of the problems caused by ethanol.&nbsp; All U.S. blends have 10% or more 
	ethanol.&nbsp; Your region may have more or less ethanol.&nbsp; Be certain to find out what your local blend ratio is!</p>
	<h4 id="Recommendations">Recommendations when using gasoline with ethanol</h4>
	<p>
	WARNING: PILOTS MUST NOT USE GASOLINE WITH MORE THAN 10% ETHANOL.&nbsp; THIS WILL DESTROY THE ENGINE!</p>
	<p>
	1.&nbsp;Always add <a href="http://www.goldeagle.com/brands/sta-bil">
	Sta-Bil</a> or <a href="http://seafoamsales.com/small-engines/">SeaFoam</a> 
	fuel treatment to ethanol blends to help preserve this unstable fuel.&nbsp; Unless Chevron premium gasoline is 
	used, it is helpful to add their Techron additive (or an equivalent) per the recommended amounts.&nbsp; It dissolves the gunk that ethanol creates.&nbsp; These additives are 
	available at auto parts stores.</p>
	<p>
	2.&nbsp;Do NOT allow gasoline with ethanol to sit for more than a month in 
	the fuel system as it can <a href="moeller-marine-ethanol-blended-fuels.pdf">
	damage</a> the metal and non-metal parts of the engine.&nbsp; If Sta-Bil is 
	used, blends can be stored in ordinary gasoline containers for many months IF NOT 
	MIXED WITH OIL.&nbsp; If pilots store  
	motors for more than a few 
	weeks, they should <a href="../purging_the_fuel_system.htm">purge</a> the fuel lines and carburetor.&nbsp; Ethanol is a powerful solvent that causes non-metal fuel system parts (tubing, gaskets, 
	diaphragms, filter material) to deteriorate quickly.&nbsp; It can cause fuel lines to swell enough to allow the pickup tube filter to fall off.&nbsp; Ethanol is hygroscopic and also conducts 
	electricity.&nbsp; This causes electrolysis of the metal parts in the engine and is why those using two stroke engines in a marine environment have so many problems.&nbsp; The metering lever 
	spring inside the Walbro carburetor will weaken from corrosion in the presence of ethanol blended fuels which is why it should be replaced every time a pilot rebuilds the carburetor.</p>
	<p>
	3.&nbsp;Pilots who use ethanol blends should regularly test the 
	<a href="../walbrowg8/popoff/pop-off-pressure.htm">pop-off 
	pressure</a> of their carburetors because of corrosion and weakening of the 
	pop-off spring caused by electrolysis and/or the presence of water.&nbsp; Miniplane-USA stocks the <a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/parts/carb.htm">springs</a> which can be changed out, if 
	your spring appears corroded.&nbsp; Low pop-off pressure dramatically affects high performance due to a richening of the fuel mixture.</p>
	<p>
	4.
	Pilots should be sure that the gasoline does not 
	contain either water (mixed in with 
	the ethanol) or more 
	than 10% ethanol.&nbsp; Wiki has a good
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline">article</a> on the 
	stability of gasoline, especially ethanol mixes, and what happens as these 
	mixes age.&nbsp; This article from <a href="http://www.machinerylubrication.com/Read/192/water-contaminant-oil">Machinery Lubrication</a> describes what happens when water gets into the fuel.</p>
	<p>
	5.
	Users of ethanol blends should rebuild their carburetors as often as needed, 
	usually once a year.</p>
	<p>
	6. Test the ethanol percentage in the fuel.&nbsp;
	For about $10, pilots can buy an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alcohol-Content-Tester-DESIGN-DTI66/dp/B001OK8Q6A/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379360594&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords=ethanol+tester">ethanol 
	percent tester</a>.&nbsp; If a 10% ethanol fuel contains water the fuel 
	tester will indicate an ethanol content &lt;10%.&nbsp; This is another reason 
	why pilots who live in humid parts of the world should not use ethanol fuels 
	in their engines unless they are certain that it is not contaminated with 
	water.&nbsp; For example, if you test fuel that is supposed to contain 
	ethanol and the tester shows it to be ethanol free, the fuel has been fully 
	saturated with water.&nbsp; Such fuel will ruin a 2 cycle engine.</p>
	<p>
	7.&nbsp;The <a href="../walbrowg8/WalbroSM.pdf">Walbro Service manual</a> notes that ethanol blends will cause carburetors designed for pure gasoline (the WG8) to run leaner and, therefore, hotter.&nbsp; This is another reason for pilots to install a 
	<a href="../CHT/cht.htm">cylinder 
	head temperature gauge</a>.</p>
	<h4>
	Miscellaneous Notes on ethanol blends from manufacturers</h4>
	<p>
	Recreational Power Engineering, the U.S. distributor of the 2 stroke Hirth engines, has 
	these <a href="recreational_power_engineering.html">recommendations</a> on 
	fuel and oil for the Hirth engine.&nbsp; They warn against using ethanol 
	fuels and synthetic oils in humid environments.&nbsp; They approve the use 
	of 
	AVGAS if anti-lead fouling additives are used.</p>
	<p>
	Marine engines and small aircraft engines have much in common.&nbsp; 
	MarineMechanic.com has this
	<a href="http://www.marinemechanic.com/new-images/2_cycle_engine_tuner.htm">
	informative article</a> on coping with the poor quality gasoline we have to 
	use these days.&nbsp; They emphasize the importance of additives and making 
	sure the engine is tuned up correctly. </p>
	<p>
	Moeller Marine Products, manufacturers of fuel system 
	components, has this 
	warning,</p>
	<blockquote class="italics">
		Ethanol is a common additive to blend the fuels with, 
	and while ethanol may not pose the environmental hazards of other gas 
	additives, the chemical properties of ethanol have the potential to&nbsp;cause 
	severe damage to engine systems.</blockquote>
	<p>
	Walbro, the manufacturer of the 
	carburetor used on Miniplane engines,
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDaOcNrS6BM&amp;feature=youtu.be">
	warns users in this video</a> about using ethanol blended fuels and how to 
	prevent damage to the carburetor and fuel system.</p>
	<p>
	Here are some photos of a Walbro carburetor that stopped working due to 
	water and gunk from gasoline with ethanol.&nbsp; In the left photo, water and gunk covers parts of the fuel pump diaphragm.&nbsp; The pump could not do its job.&nbsp; In the right 
	photo, the fuel inlet screen is clogged.&nbsp; This carburetor could not deliver 
	fuel.&nbsp; The pilot was lucky that he did not burn up his engine.</p>
	<p>

	<img alt="clogged fuel inlet filter on a Walbro WG-8" height="240" src="DSCN3923_01.JPG" width="320"></p>
	<p>
	I discussed ethanol 
	fuels with 
	Bel-Ray, a manufacturer of 2-stroke motorcycle racing lubricants.&nbsp; They 
	noted that their oils mix correctly with ethanol fuels but warn users 
	that the fuel must not have ethanol &gt;10%.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
	FRAM, a manufacturer of filters, 
	<a href="http://www.fram.com/media/7069/fram_hp_product_specs.pdf">warns 
	users</a> not to use ethanol fuels that have more than 10% ethanol because 
	it will damage their filters.&nbsp; Poulan, a chain saw manufacturer, warns 
	of the <a href="from-poulan.htm">serious problems</a> caused by blends with 
	ethanol &gt;10% or which have been contaminated with water.&nbsp;
	<a href="http://www.seastarsolutions.com/products/engine-and-drive-parts/fuel-systems/filtration/fuel-filters/fuel-filters-inline-maintenance-technology/">
	Seastar Solutions</a>, a major manufacturer of marine fuel system parts, 
	warns owners to replace their fuel filters every 50 hours or once a year 
	because of the effects of ethanol in gasoline.&nbsp; They also warn owners 
	that ethanol causes deterioration of fuel system lines, making them hard and 
	brittle from the inside out.</p>
	<p>
	Bottom line: Use gasoline without ethanol.</p>
	<p>
	The 
	piston pictured below seized as a result of a lack of 
	lubrication.&nbsp; The owner of this Top 80 stated that he did 
	not put gasoline without oil in his motor.&nbsp; The likely explanation is that 
	the ethanol fuel had been contaminated with water, 
	causing the lubricating oil to separate out.&nbsp; Chris Barker of
	<a href="http://www.royalpurpleconsumer.com/contact/">Royal Purple</a> 
	synthetic oils confirmed in a telephone call to me that water contaminated 
	ethanol fuels will do this.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="piston ruined from lack of lubrication" src="fuelOil.jpg" width="288" height="384" class="imgftleft">To 
	find sources of ethanol free fuel, 
	go to this site -&gt; <a href="http://pure-gas.org">http://pure-gas.org</a>.&nbsp; 
	If you find ethanol free fuel at a service station, check it before filling 
	up as it may be mislabeled.&nbsp; Unfortunately, ethanol free fuels are becoming 
	more difficult to find.&nbsp; The karting and dirtbike guys can help 
	pilots find good fuel if AVGAS is not available but it is expensive.</p>
	<h3>Fresh Fuel ONLY</h3>
	<p>Unless AVGAS is used, be certain that fuel is fresh (less than 2 weeks old is best).&nbsp; Those who live 
	in humid climates must exercise much greater care when using fuels mixed with 
	ethanol because of the hazard of water contamination.&nbsp; If
	fuel stabilizer is 
	used, ordinary gasoline can stored for a year or so (but I never would store 
	it this long).</p>
	<p>All service station 
	gasoline (other than AVGAS) deteriorates quickly and loses its octane value after 
	just a few weeks 
	because of oxidation.&nbsp; If you store gasoline, add a fuel 
	stabilizer like
	Sta-Bil 
	which can keep it fresh for a year in sealed containers.&nbsp; There is also a product from 
	Sta-Bil that is specifically for fuels used in marine (humid) environments 
	called
	<a href="http://www.goldeagle.com/product/marine-sta-bil-ethanol-fuel-treatment-stabilizer">
	Marine Formula Sta-Bil</a>.&nbsp; If I lived in a particularly hot and humid 
	climate, I would add this special version of Sta-Bil to my fuel if AVGAS was not available.</p>
	<p>Honda Motor Co. has these words about the importance of fresh fuel,</p>
	<blockquote><span class="italics">"Fuel deterioration and oxidation can occur in as little as 30 days and may cause damage to the carburetor and/or fuel system.&nbsp; ...Deteriorated gasoline will 
	cause hard starting, and it leaves gum deposits that clog the fuel system.&nbsp; If the gasoline in your engine deteriorates during storage you may need to have the carburetor and other fuel 
	system components serviced and replaced.&nbsp; ...You can extend fuel storage life by adding a gasoline stabilizer that is formulated for that purpose, or you can avoid fuel deterioration problems 
	by draining the fuel tank and carburetor." -- from the 2011 Owner's Manual for the GX120, GX160, and GX200</span></blockquote>
	<h3>Aviation Gasoline</h3>
	<p>AVGAS may be used in paramotor engines and is preferable to all other fuels, especially those containing ethanol.&nbsp; All engine manufacturers note that AVGAS does not harm their engines, contrary to various rumors that circulate on the blogs.&nbsp; 
	In fact, some manufacturers specify that ONLY aviation gasoline should be used in their engines.&nbsp; AVGAS is, by far, the best fuel if your ambient air temperature is over 100 degrees F.&nbsp; 
	For those who heed the rumor-mills, the conspiracy theory types, the ignorant, etc. Southwest Airsports can give you this guarantee:&nbsp; We will repair FOR FREE any engine that has been 
	supposedly damaged by AVGAS.&nbsp; However, this offer does NOT apply if the wrong oil has been used or the engine has overheated.&nbsp; Contact us for details.&nbsp; We have repeatedly requested 
	photographs, the affected parts, etc. from the rumor-mill people but have yet to receive anything.</p>
	<h4>AVGAS Facts</h4>
	<p>1. It has the highest octane of all gasoline.<br>
	2. It contains the octane enhancing compound tetraethyl lead.&nbsp; When this compound is burned, it forms lead monoxide deposits which coat various parts of the combustion chamber, especially 
	the spark plug.&nbsp; According to the aviation engine manufacturer, ROTAX, lead deposits can damage the crankshaft bearings due to 
	their flaking off and then being sucked back into the crankcase in their multi-piston two stroke engines.&nbsp; This is something that cannot happen in single cylinder paramotor engines.&nbsp; Some claim that
	<a href="https://www.hastingsmfg.com/ServiceTips/piston.htm">ring sticking</a> 
	is more common from the additional lead deposits in AVGAS than from the carbon deposits 
	created by the use of any fuel.&nbsp; There is no proof of this.&nbsp; Ring sticking is usually caused by the use of cheap oils and/or engine
	<a href="http://www.arboristsite.com/community/threads/stuck-piston-ring-husky-435.109056/">
	overheating</a>, regardless of whether the fuel is leaded or unleaded.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, overheating is a common problem in engines which are not properly maintained.<br>3. It is the most stable of all gasoline and can be stored for long periods (years). <br>4. It will not cause 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor_lock">vapor lock</a>, a serious conditions that causes fuel starvation and can destroy an engine.<br>
	5. It will not harm fuel system parts, as does gasoline containing ethanol.<br>6. 
	Cost is about double that of premium unleaded.<br>7. It mixes well with all types of 2 stroke oil, especially the full synthetic oils.<br>8. It does cause increased fouling of spark plugs and, to a lesser extent, results in more deposits in the combustion 
	chamber.&nbsp; This is remedied by the use of approved fuel additives (see below). <br></p>
	<p>Wiki has a long 
	article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avgas">aviation gasoline</a> 
	for those who desire to increase their knowledge of engine fuels rather than rely on hearsay and rumors from the ignorant.</p>
	<p>Pilots in our region have used AVGAS (without the TCP additive) in various paramotors for years without problems.</p>
	<p>The <a href="http://www.thumpertalk.com/topic/169121-aviation-fuel-in-motorcycle/">dirt-bike </a>and <a href="http://www.vintagekarts.com/forum/view_topic.php?id=4937&amp;forum_id=2">go kart</a> 
	guys laugh at the AVGAS rumors.&nbsp; For every PPG pilot there are probably 10,000 bikers and kart racers -- guys who know everything there is about high-output 2 stroke engines.&nbsp; I regularly go to their forums to get tips on how to improve the life and performance of 
	the engines we use.&nbsp; They are a 
	huge help to us and are the ones who provided the world with the easy fix for the annoying <a href="../walbrowg8/midrange_performance/midrange_performance_problems.htm">midrange performance issues</a> 
	we have with paramotors.</p>
	<h4>Fuel treatment for AVGAS</h4>
	<p>If AVGAS is treated with the additive
	<a href="http://www.aircraftspruce.com/catalog/appages/alcortcp.php?clickkey=9421">
	TCP</a> (or an equivalent), the nuisance of lead fouling is eliminated.&nbsp; A quart of TCP 
	(cost &lt;$40 US) will treat 320 gallons.&nbsp; This comes 
	out to about $ 0.13/gal, and is well worth it, considering that less 
	engine maintenance will be needed.&nbsp; The downside is this additive, like all additives, tends to eat 
	away at the non-metal parts of the fuel system.</p>
	<p>Below is a spark plug from an engine that used AVGAS treated with the TCP additive.&nbsp; The plug is nearly worn out but virtually free of lead deposits.&nbsp; Just prior to this plug being 
	removed, the engine had been idling for a long period which is why the plug has a large amount of black soot on it.&nbsp; Contrary to the spark plugs in 
	multi-cylinder 4-stroke aviation engines, the ones used in the Top 80 cost a small fraction and are easily replaced when fouled.&nbsp; The cooler running temperature of the Top 80 
	(when properly maintained and tuned) prevents the problems often associated with overheating.&nbsp; If an engine is not properly maintained, 
	it does not matter what kind of fuel is used -- it will experience problems and possible damage.</p>
	<p><img alt="spark plug from an engine that uses AVGAS treated with the TCP additive" height="483" src="DSCN4017%20-%20Copy.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>This spark plug is from an AVGAS burning engine that was not properly maintained by the pilot.&nbsp; Note that the fouling is only present close to the grounded 
	electrode and absent from the cooler parts of the plug.&nbsp; The cylinder and piston have minimal lead deposits.&nbsp; The only symptom the engine had was hard-starting because the plug is worn 
	out.&nbsp; Lead deposits can be eliminated by the correct fuel additive (TCP).&nbsp; Engines that use ethanol blends will not last as long and why any other kind of fuel is preferable.&nbsp; 
	Regardless of what kind of fuel is used, the spark plug will wear out and/or foul.&nbsp; It is so cheap to change out the spark plug and greatly improve starting and high end performance.</p>

	<p>Here is a plug from a Polini Thor 130 used for tandem flying.&nbsp; AVGAS treated with the TCP additive was used exclusively in the engine.&nbsp; It has about 30 hours on it and is at the end 
	of its life.&nbsp; Even so, the plug has very light lead fouling.&nbsp; The cylinder head and piston crown will have even less fouling.&nbsp; Compare the plug below with the plug above.&nbsp; Both 
	engines had about the same number of hours on their respective plugs.&nbsp; It shows what a difference the TCP fuel additive makes.</p>

	<p>Below is a photo of an EGT sensor that has a small coating of lead monoxide (light yellow in color) from the burning of AVGAS without the TCP additive.&nbsp; It is a harmless powdery substance and is easily removed with a wire brush.&nbsp;&nbsp;As 
	with carbon deposits, the lead deposits must be removed periodically from the top of the piston and cylinder head, along with the carbon deposits.&nbsp; This is necessary to help the engine cool 
	more efficiently.</p>

	<h3>Sticking piston rings</h3>
	<p>Running any engine too hot (lean conditions) will cause the 
	lubricating oil to burn at the lands, including the sides of the piston, due to piston overheating, regardless of 
	what kind of fuel is used.&nbsp; This creates the black gummy deposits which 
	can bind the ring.</p>
	<p>This piston came from a fuel starved engine which overheated.&nbsp; Even though unleaded fuel was used, the piston was hot enough to burn the lubricating oil coating the surface of the piston.&nbsp; 
	Fully synthetic oil can get much hotter than other types of oil before it will burn (oxidize) and why this type of oil is preferable to others.&nbsp; The piston ring was stuck in the lands due to the burnt oil.&nbsp; The pilot flew this engine at the beach.&nbsp; The long vertical gouge was caused by 
	a sand grain getting sucked into the engine and then caught between the cylinder and the piston.</p>
	<p><img alt="overheated piston showing burnt oil on the skirts" height="480" src="DSCN3984_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>Cheap fuel/oil, old fuel, and/or ethanol 
	fuels contaminated by water will leave damaging
	<a href="http://www.marinemechanic.com/site/page95.html">deposits</a> that can find their way into the piston ring and cause it to stick.&nbsp; Another problem with the cheap oils is that they 
	tend to rapidly clog the decompression port, if present, on 2 stroke engines.&nbsp; Lead deposits from AVGAS are not black and gummy but 
	light yellow. </p>
	<h2>2 STROKE OILS</h2>
	<p>Note:&nbsp; Miniplane has updated (as of July 2016) their requirements recently due to changes in gasoline blends throughout the western world i.e. the increased use of ethanol.</p>
	<p><span class="bold">Thor and Top 80 engines</span> --Miniplane recommends semi-synthetic 2-cycle oil at a 2% mix (50:1 ratio).&nbsp; Do not use fully synthetic oils at the 2% mix ratio.</p>
	<p><span class="bold">Minari engines</span> -- fully synthetic oil at 2.5%.</p>
	<p><span class="bold">Simonini engines</span> -- fully synthetic oil at 2.0%
	</p>
	<p><span class="bold">Greater mix ratio</span> -- Miniplane recommends a 1.5% mix (67:1 ratio) for 
	the Top 80 and Thor models if fully synthetic oil ONLY is used.&nbsp; However, do NOT use gasoline containing ethanol at the higher mix ratios!&nbsp; You MUST use either AVGAS (preferably) or 
	premium unleaded that has NO ethanol in it.</p>
	<p>The brands of oil Miniplane recommends for a 1.5% mix are not available in 
	the U.S.&nbsp; However, the recommended brands all have the
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JASO_FC">JASO</a> FD rating.&nbsp; Why use the lesser oil mix?&nbsp; Engines using the 1.5% mix 
	will run cooler and more efficiently.&nbsp; In addition, the lower ratio has less negative impact on the octane value of the fuel.<br>
	</p>
	<h3>Fully synthetic oils</h3>
	<p>These oils have the required JASO FD rating.&nbsp; DO NOT USE OIL THAT IS NOT JASO FD!</p>

	<p>The cost of the synthetic blends is substantially less.&nbsp; The 
	advantage of mineral oils used in the semi-synthetic blends is that they do not attract water, like the fully 
	synthetic oils.&nbsp; Pilots who live in humid environments might want to 
	consider this advantage.&nbsp; The mineral oils also mix better with ethanol 
	blends.&nbsp; Hirth, for example, specifically advises not to use fully synthetic oils 
	with fuels containing ethanol.</p>
	<h3>Fuel oil ratio<br> </h3>
	<p>Some mix their fuel at a 
	lesser ratio than the recommended 50:1 for the Top 80, e.g. 40:1, thinking that it helps lubricate engine parts better or is necessary when breaking in a new Top 80.&nbsp; Both Miniplane and Polini warn against this practice as it can damage an engine.&nbsp; Be sure to always follow the recommendations of the engine manufacturer.&nbsp; Pilots have to resist rumors and hearsay 
	and stick to the engine manual.</p>
	<p>Here is a
	<a href="http://www.smokstak.com/articles/oils.html">discussion</a> of what can happen when lower fuel oil ratios are used in engines where this is not recommended.&nbsp; It will lean out the fuel 
	burn and can foul the combustion chamber, including the piston ring, regardless of the type of gasoline used.</p>
	<p>Minari has this note in their user manual, "<span class="italics">WARNING: Please note that an excessive amount of oil does not 
	stretch the life of the engine. a wrong quantity of oil leads to seizure."</span></p>
	<p>Everything depends on how the engine is engineered.&nbsp; Do not experiment with the fuel/oil ratio!</p>
	<h3>Mix the oil just before use</h3>
	<p>Per Miniplane's recommendation and the experience of many pilots, it is always best to 
	mix small quantities of oil and fuel just before use and not store the mix 
	more than (2) weeks.&nbsp; The lubricating properties of the oil are 
	affected by long term contact with any kind of gasoline, with additives and especially with ethanol 
	blends.&nbsp; I mix fuel 
	and oil (2) gallons at a time.&nbsp; It is a nuisance but it means my fuel 
	mix is always fresh, especially the oil.</p>

	like most.&nbsp; To view their fuel and oil recommendations, click on this
