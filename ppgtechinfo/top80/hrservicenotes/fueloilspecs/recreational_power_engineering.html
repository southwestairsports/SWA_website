	<h1>Recreational Power Engineering - Fuel and Oil Recommendations</h1>
	<p>Note: Matt at <a href="http://www.recpower.com/">RPE</a> forwarded us 
	this information concerning fuel and oil for the Hirth engine.</p>
	<h2>Ethanol Auto Fuel&nbsp;vs. AVGAS</h2>
	<p>In lower quality engines ethanol can be a problem as it can eat up the 
	seals and gaskets. Hirth engines use Viton tipped crank seals and high grade 
	paper type gaskets and we have found no evidence so far that ethanol will 
	damage them internally. So if you have no other option you can use it.</p>
	<p>Ethanol should be avoided if possible if you can find an unleaded - non 
	ethanol fuel source. Racing fuel can be used if 100 or less octane. Another 
	source is possibly from a marina and some gas stations sell small engine 
	fuel that is pure. Sometimes small engine gas is only 87 octane which is on 
	the low side but we consider it better than ethanol fuel. If you elect to 
	use low octane small engine fuel you should not store it for more than a 
	month. Ethanol is nasty stuff that can shorten the life of fuel lines, fuel 
	pump, primer pumps and will destroy fiberglass fuel tanks. It attracts 
	moisture into the fuel and engine, increases the EGT a little, is not as 
	efficient and lowers the HP a small amount. If used replacing all the above 
	mentioned fuel components yearly should be considered and precautions taken 
	to keep moisture out during long downtimes. We do not recommend the use of 
	synthetic 2 cycle oils regardless of what fuel you use but with ethanol fuel 
	it is really important not to use synthetics.&nbsp; Use a high quality mineral 
	based 2 cycle oil.</p>
	<p>AV Gas has some very positive attributes but some negative ones that 
	should be considered. 100LL has higher octane which the Hirth engine loves 
	and is supposed to be certified dry â€“ no water. It has no ethanol which is 
	good. But it has lead and that is bad. Leaded fuel leaves a nasty yellow 
	deposit in the engine that collects similar to carbon deposits. Unlike 
	carbon which sticks like cement the lead deposits can eventually break of in 
	large pieces. If they break off at the right time they go harmlessly out the 
	exhaust. If at the wrong time they can end up in the crankcase. The lead 
	deposits are gritty like sand and if they get into the case will destroy the 
	crank bearings in a short time. The lead also seems to make rings stick 
	faster than carbon deposits. Another downside of 100LL is the high cost and 
	the inconvenience of having to run out to an airport to get it.&nbsp; If 100LL 
	did not have the lead added it would logically be your best choice and still 
	can be. One option would be to do a topend de-carbon of the engine every 50 
	hours to remove the lead before it builds up. Another option would be to use 
	a fuel additive called TCP fuel additive. This is a product that you add a 
	few ounces to every tank full. It has the ability to trap the lead and make 
	it go harmlessly out the exhaust, We have several customers who use it with 
	our blue Max oil and there does not seem to be any negative attributes. You 
	can purchase it from Aircraft Spruce or Wicks. There is no problem with 
	occasional&nbsp;use of 100LL like on a cross country. TCP is only needed for 
	constant long term use.</p>
	<p>So the short answer is. Unleaded pure fuel can be used as is, leaded fuel 
	can be used with TCP and premium ethanol auto fuel can be used if you take 
	some precautions.</p>
