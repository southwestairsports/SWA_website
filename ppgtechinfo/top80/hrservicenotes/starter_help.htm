	<h1>Starter -- tips on how to help it last longer</h1>
	<h2>1. Reducing the engine stop forces on the starter</h2>
	<p>Inherent in the design of the Top 80 starter is that the pawls will engage the starter reel when the engine speed is below a few hundred RPM.&nbsp; This would not matter except that that the 
	pawls and starter reel take a beating.&nbsp; When the engine slows down almost to zero RPM, it will not have enough momentum to make it through top dead center.&nbsp; Instead of continuing in the 
	same direction, the engine reverses itself and grabs the starter reel at the same time, putting a terrific yank on it.&nbsp; As the starter begins to turn backwards, it is stopped by the action of 
	the cord.</p>
	<p>This yank puts a tremendous amount of extra wear on the entire mechanism.&nbsp; How is this fixed?</p>
	<p>While we cannot stop the reverse yank at all times, we can cut it in half, more or less, by pulling the starter out a foot or two and THEN stopping the engine.&nbsp; As the engine dies (and 
	reverses), release the starter.&nbsp; The result is no more violent yanks.</p>
	<p>This is a small task but over the life of the engine (and starter) it will make a difference.</p>
	<h2>2. Starter lubrication</h2>
	<p>Every 50 hours or so, remove the starter, the center screw, and the starter reel.&nbsp; Put a small amount of white lithium grease on the starter shaft.&nbsp; These surfaces are plastic and 
	will quickly wear if not lubricated periodically.&nbsp; DO NOT OVER-LUBRICATE ANY PART OF THE STARTER.&nbsp; The cooling fan is a powerful vacuum cleaner and it sucks ambient air (along with dust) 
	into the starter.&nbsp; This is just another reason why it is best to launch from grass or clean concrete rather than from a dirt field or, worst of all, from a beach.</p>
	<p>Any binding of the starter spring must be addressed promptly.&nbsp; Pilots who fly in dusty or sandy environments will quickly gum up the starter spring.&nbsp; It must be removed, wiped down 
	thoroughly with a rag soaked with mineral spirits, and then lubricated sparingly with light machine oil, NOT WITH ENGINE OIL!&nbsp; Harbor Freight sells air-tool oil (#68094) and it should always 
	be used to lubricate moving parts on a paramotor.</p>
	<h2>3. A better pulley</h2>
	<p>The OEM pulley from Miniplane is of miserable quality and construction.&nbsp; It works briefly -- but that's it.&nbsp; A superior pulley is the Harken which is available everywhere in the world.&nbsp; Sailrite sells the <a href="http://www.sailrite.com/Harken-Bullet-Block-Single#">Harken 082 Single Bullet Block</a> 
	which easily replaces the OEM pulley.&nbsp; There is no comparison between the two.</p>
