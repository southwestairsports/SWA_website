	<h1>Reed valves</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Warning for Top 80 engines: A loose or improperly torqued down reed valve body can leak air causing the fuel pump to fail.&nbsp; A failed fuel pump will lean out the fuel mixture resulting in engine overheating 
	and irreversible topend damage.&nbsp; I advise that all Top 80 owners be certain that their reed valve bodies are properly torqued down and that blue threadlock be used on the screws.</p>
	<p>Two cycle engines do not have intake or exhaust valves 
	like in a four cycle engine.&nbsp; When the piston moves up, a vacuum is 
	created in the crankcase which is also connected to the carburetor and 
	air/fuel is sucked into the crankcase.&nbsp; When the piston goes down, 
	pressure is created in the crankcase.&nbsp; If it were not for the reed 
	valves, the air/fuel would be forced right back out the carburetor instead 
	of being pushed up into the combustion chamber through a port that is opened 
	by the downward movement of the piston.&nbsp; The reed valve is located 
	between the carburetor and the engine crankcase.</p>
	<p>As reed petals age, they loose their straightness, may be chipped, 
	and bend more easily.&nbsp; As a result they will not close and open at the right moment.&nbsp; The result is an engine with less 
	performance.&nbsp; The engine may also spit at the carburetor or drip 
	fuel excessively.&nbsp; Polini recommends that pilots replace the petals every (100) 
	hours of engine time.</p>
	<p>One ingenious blogger (not a Miniplane blogger) figured out a way to test 
	for major failure of the reed valves without removing them from the engine:</p>
	<blockquote class="italics">I've found [reed valve leaks] by listening. Remove the spark plugs, the air 
	box over the carburetors, and open the throttle butterflies all the way. Now 
	get someone to spin the motor, either with the starter, or by rope pull, 
	while you listen though the carburetor throats. Use a piece of clear plastic 
	aquarium air line tubing for a stethoscope and put it down into the 
	carburetor throats. On a good reed, you will here a single air intake event 
	per crank rotation. With a bad one, you will hear what sounds like breathing 
	in and out with two air movements per crank cycle. This only really works 
	well if your motor has a single carburetor throat for each cylinder.</blockquote>
	<h2>Test &amp; Examination</h2>
	<p>To 
	examine and test the reed valve, it must be removed from the engine.&nbsp; To access the (2) reed valve screws, the carburetor must be removed.</p>
	<p>If the petals are curved away from the valve body, cracked, chipped, or 
	deformed, they must be replaced.&nbsp; An easy way to see if the petals are 
	closing symmetrically is to put a small led flashlight into the valve body 
	and look around the outside edges of the valve body for light.&nbsp; The 
	light seen, if any, should be uniform around the part of the reed that 
	opens.&nbsp; There should be no gaps.&nbsp; Your reed cage may 
	not be perfectly flat which will cause a small gap (&lt;0.5mm) between the reed 
	petal and the cage that is not uniform around the edge of the petal.&nbsp; 
	This is not a cause of great concern but is another annoying QC issue.</p>
	<p>If 
	the petals look OK, they will still need to be checked for their closing 
	force.&nbsp; To check this condition, you will need a letter scale that can 
	be held in the hand and some dental floss.&nbsp; Carefully lift a petal with 
	a toothpick and thread a piece of floss under the lip of the petal, through 
	the center slot, through the bolt hole, and tie it around the long 
	carburetor bolt.&nbsp; Make a loop in the other end of the floss.&nbsp; 
	Using the scale, measure the force needed to lift the reed petals 2mm (see 
	arrow on 2nd photo).&nbsp; The value should be about 2.5 oz.&nbsp; If it is 
	less than 2 oz. I would replace the petals.&nbsp; Be sure to check both 
	petals of the reed valve.</p>
	<p>Even if the petals opening force is 
	correct, the petals may still have to be replaced if they are more than a 
	few years old.&nbsp; New petals are a good 
	investment that will keep your paramotor running well.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/pages/parts.htm">
	Miniplane-USA</a> stocks the correct petals.</p>

	<p>The red 
	arrow points to the measurable gap between the reed petal and the valve 
	body.</p>

	<p>
	When replacing the petals be sure to use blue 
	threadlock on the screws and make certain the new petals are as flat as 
	possible.</p>
	<p>
	When reattaching the reed valve to the crankcase, be CERTAIN to clean the threaded hole and screws with brake cleaner.&nbsp; Apply blue threadlock to the screws and torque to specifications (4-5 Nm).&nbsp; 
	If you do not do this correctly, the valve body will leak and the fuel pump will not work adequately.&nbsp; This is because the valve body contains the ports that go from the crankcase to the 
	carburetor and then to the fuel pump diaphragm.</p>
