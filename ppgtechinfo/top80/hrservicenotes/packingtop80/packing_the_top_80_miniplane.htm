	<h1>Packing the Top 80 for Shipment</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>Read this entirely 
	BEFORE beginning to pack the Top 80.</p>
	<p>The final shipping weight of the 
	Top 80 will be about (55) lbs.</p>
	<p>Make sure you do not exceed 70 lbs.&nbsp; 
	Shipping the paramotor as luggage on an airline has always been hit or miss.&nbsp; 
	Will they accept it?&nbsp; It so depends on the airline and, especially, the 
	airport you are flying out of/in to.&nbsp; Foreign and northeastern airports 
	(Logan Airport, in particular) tend to be harsh on travelers with nit-picky 
	officials looking for excuses to foul up your plans.&nbsp; Always be 
	prepared to ship it via FEDEX or UPS.&nbsp; Make up shipping labels for the 
	"just in case."&nbsp; Just because they let you check it one way does not 
	mean you can check it the other way back.&nbsp; I have been bit by that 
	piece of incongruousness....</p>
	<h2>
Supplies needed:</h2>
	<blockquote>
	a.)&nbsp; 19" x 19" x 40" heavy duty corrugated cardboard container.&nbsp; 
	Bigger boxes may not be accepted by either the airlines<br>
	or commercial shippers as non-freight (UPS or FEDEX).&nbsp; The size specified here is the minimum that will work.<br>
	b.)&nbsp; About 2 sq. ft. of 1 1/2" thick hard foam packing material<br>
	c.)&nbsp; Soft foam to plug the spark plug hole and exhaust port<br> 
	d.)&nbsp; HD plastic bags, bubble wrap, and packing tape<br> 
	e.)&nbsp; Empty plastic water bottles with the caps on  –  they are a great packing material to fill up empty space in the box.<br>
	f.)&nbsp; Be sure to have "blue" Locktite on hand when reassembling the muffler attachment bolts.</blockquote>
	
	<p>There must be no traces of fuel in your 
	packed Top 80 if you plan to ship it on a commercial airline.&nbsp; If fuel 
	vapors are present or detected in your shipping container, you could get in 
	BIG
	<a href="http://www.footflyer.com/PPGBibleUpdates/Chapter08/Shipping_A_Paramotor/Shipping_Ultralight.htm">
	trouble</a>.</p>
	<h2>Steps:</h2>
	<p>1. Disassemble the Top 80  –  Remove:&nbsp; 
	the harness and arms from the frame (leave the arms attached to the harness), the netting and all 
	sticks/rods, the muffler, the airbox, the propeller (if it is a single 
	piece, it will have to be shipped separately), the fuel tank cap and the cap 
	with the fuel suction line, and the tank.&nbsp; Detach the fuel line from 
	both the carburetor and the quick release fitting.&nbsp; Remove the spark 
	plug.</p>
	<p>2. Remove all traces of fuel from the system if shipping by air  –  To remove fuel from engine 
	parts, compressed air is the best way to do it.&nbsp; A hair dryer also 
	works for the fuel tank.&nbsp; "Baking" the carburetor in an oven at about 
	200 degrees overnight will also get every trace of fuel out of it.&nbsp; 
	Putting the fuel tank in the hot sun for an afternoon will do the job.&nbsp; 
	A rule that the airlines may enforce is "anything other than new which has 
	had fuel in it cannot go as luggage."&nbsp; This means the carburetor and 
	the fuel tank including the lines.&nbsp; Because of a
	<a href="http://www.footflyer.com/PPGBibleUpdates/Chapter08/Shipping_A_Paramotor/Shipping_Ultralight.htm">
	recent adventure </a>of a pilot who had his engine confiscated, I recommend 
	that these be removed and shipped separately.&nbsp; They are lightweight and 
	you will avoid being hassled, fined, etc.&nbsp; Even better, ship just the 
	entire engine sans muffler separately via FEDEX/UPS.&nbsp; Shipping the 
	carburetor, fuel lines, and fuel tank via 2nd day air is not too expensive.</p>
	<p>ALWAYS GET TO THE AIRPORT (2) HOURS OR MORE AHEAD OF TIME IN CASE 
	YOU HAVE PROBLEMS.&nbsp; Most airports have a FEDEX or UPS facility close by 
	so you can ship your paramotor if you have to.</p>
	<p>3. Stuff small pieces 
	of soft foam into the spark hole and the exhaust port to prevent foreign 
	objects from accidently getting in like a nut or bolt.</p>
	<p>4. Use the stiff 
	foam to pad the Top 80.&nbsp; The weight of the paramotor is the engine.&nbsp; 
	All packing must be carefully attached to the area around the engine, to the 
	bottom of the frame, and the top of the engine.&nbsp; Re-attach the fuel 
	tank (if it was removed) but not the fuel lines  –  be certain the fuel caps are not on the tank!&nbsp; 
	The wrapped muffler fits nicely along the side of the motor per the photo.&nbsp; 
	The airbox fits well just above the fuel tank.&nbsp; Wrap the harness in a 
	HD plastic bag and slide it down the front all the way to the bottom.&nbsp; 
	Watch out for the throttle cable.&nbsp; Place the wrapped netting hardware 
	in a corner of the box diagonally.&nbsp; You must add packing material 
	between the top of the motor and the top of the box.&nbsp; THE PARAMOTOR 
	CANNOT MOVE WHEN IN THE BOX.&nbsp; A two piece propeller fits nicely in the 
	box but not a single blade type which will have to be shipped separately.</p>
	<p>Look at the following photos carefully for tips on how to place the stiff 
	foam material.&nbsp; Be sure to LABEL the foam pieces for next time.</p>

	<p>5. Be sure to put the 
	labels on the side of the box that has the harness side of the Top 80.&nbsp; 
	Do not put the labels on the top/bottom of the box.&nbsp; If you do it 
	correctly, you will not have to drain the redrive oil.&nbsp;&nbsp; If, 
	somehow, the box is stored prop side up or upside down  –  you may have a 
	small mess.&nbsp; You might want to wrap the redrive with an old towel, 
	just in case.</p>
	<p>6. If shipping by FEDEX or UPS, be sure to <strong>insure it 
	for full value</strong>.&nbsp; It is rare but these people can be terribly rough on 
	shipments (we just had a Top 80 destroyed by FEDEX ground).&nbsp; The most 
	common damage is that your frame will get bent beyond repair ($1,200 for 
	new).&nbsp; The cost of being overweight as airline luggage is just a little 
	more than sending it via FEDEX/UPS ground and is easier on your paramotor as 
	the airline baggage handlers will not be as likely to crush/throw your 
	package.&nbsp; FEDEX or UPS 2nd Day Air is the best way to ship anything 
	because packages are not handled by machines.</p>
	<p>However, it is 
	expensive.&nbsp; Getting insurance with the airlines is sometimes impossible 
	so check with your home/auto insurance company to see if they can insure 
	your engine if you ship it via commercial airline.</p>
	<p>Note:&nbsp; I am sorry 
	to say that shipping anything these days has substantial risk  –  so be 
	prepared.&nbsp; Just be thankful you were not the hang glider pilots from 
	Australia who traveled to Florida one year for a competition we were at.&nbsp; 
	They had their brand new gliders bent in half by baggage handler idiots 
	using fork lifts.&nbsp; I have seen America West baggage handlers throw 
	luggage from the belly of the plane onto the&nbsp; tarmac  –  a distance of 
	about 8'.&nbsp; No packing can prevent this sort of mishandling.</p>
