	<h1>Engine overheating</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>Overheating in paramotor engines is almost always caused by fuel 
	starvation when the engine is run at high loads (1/2 throttle or above).&nbsp; 
	Rarely, it can be caused by the addition of too much oil to the fuel 
	mixture or failing to mix oil with the gasoline.</p>
	<p>When too much air and not enough fuel enters the cylinder, the 
	temperature of combustion is much higher than normal.&nbsp; The engine 
	cooling system is unable to do its job and the engine temperature increases.&nbsp; 
	As it increases two critical things happen: the piston begins to expand and 
	the lubricating oil mixed with the gasoline begins to burn in the wrong 
	places.&nbsp; As the temperature increases, the piston can expand enough 
	so that it seizes in the cylinder.&nbsp; This causes irreparable damage to both 
	parts.&nbsp; The pilot may notice a sudden drop in RPM.&nbsp; While the 
	engine may run after it cools down, the cylinder is damaged enough that 
	power output is dramatically less.</p>
	<p>In a normally operating engine, the cylinder wall and piston are cool 
	enough so that the lubricating oil will not burn when it contacts either 
	surface.&nbsp; Because the piston has no way of conducting heat except by 
	contact with the cylinder, it is always the hottest of the two parts and 
	where we 
	will first see evidence of overheating.&nbsp; The oil must 
	not get too hot in order to do its job: lubricating the  
	piston as it moves up and down in the cylinder.&nbsp; When combustion 
	temperature exceeds a certain value, e.g. 300C degrees, the oil burns and can no longer lubricate 
	the moving parts.&nbsp; In addition, the piston cannot cool fast enough and will begin to expand.&nbsp; At this point, damage occurs.</p>
	<p>Here are photos of some Top 80 pistons, one normal and one that 
	overheated.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="normal Top 80 piston" height="240" src="DSCN3897_01.JPG" width="320">&nbsp;

	<p>When an engine is functioning normally, the fuel oil mixture burns inside 
	the cylinder but not on the actual metal surfaces.&nbsp; As the piston on 
	the right heated up, the oil on its surface (and, to a lesser extent, on the 
	cylinder wall) became scorched and started burning on the surface of the 
	piston.&nbsp; Instead of oil lubricating the 
	surfaces, there was just brown gunk.&nbsp; If the piston gets overheated 
	quickly, the top may get a hole burned right through it.</p>
	<p>In addition, the piston ring had also become "stuck" in its lands 
	(groove).&nbsp; That is, the overheated, scorched/burnt oil will form a type of 
	glue between the piston ring and the lands.&nbsp; If the piston ring is no 
	longer free to move about the lands, it can't do its job of sealing the 
	combustion chamber, especially when the fuel air mixture is ignited by the 
	spark plug.&nbsp; Overheating is the #1 cause of piston ring sticking, 
	regardless of the type of fuel or oil used.</p>
	<p>Often, the top of the piston during normal operation will get hot enough 
	to harmlessly burn the oil on the underside but this can only be observed 
	if the piston is removed from the connecting rod.</p>
	<p>If the piston and cylinder wall are not lubricated properly, they will 
	quickly wear out and fail.&nbsp; It is very important that pilots do not let 
	their engines overheat.&nbsp; In other words, how can fuel starvation be 
	prevented?&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Here are the most common causes:</p>
	<p>1.&nbsp;Fuel pump diaphragm failure -- Using ethanol fuel blends greatly 
	accelerates the deterioration of the material used in the diaphragm.&nbsp; 
	The pump will still work but its output declines.&nbsp; When the engine is 
	run at full throttle, the pump cannot keep up and the engine leans out.&nbsp; 
	We recommend that the carburetor be rebuilt and the metering lever spring replaced at least once a year.&nbsp; This (and 
	changing the spark plug) is the most important routine maintenance task on a 
	paramotor.&nbsp; Rebuild kits and metering lever springs are available from
	<a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/parts/carb.htm">Miniplane-USA</a>.</p>
	<p>2.&nbsp;Clogged fuel filters -- There are three filters on the Miniplane 
	engines: one at the bottom of the pickup tube in the fuel tank, one inline 
	filter near the carburetor, and a very fine screen filter between the fuel 
	pump and metering diaphragm chamber in the carburetor.&nbsp; The filter on 
	the end of the fuel tank pickup tube is the most subject to clogging, 
	especially if ethanol fuels are used.&nbsp; Ethanol is a powerful solvent 
	which also attracts water.&nbsp; It can form gooey gels that will quickly 
	clog this filter.</p>
	<p>3.&nbsp;IClogging of the fuel pump port/tubing to the 
	crankcase -- The fuel pump is operated by the pressure pulses created in the 
	engine crankcase.&nbsp; Some engines have a small piece of tubing that goes from the crankcase to the fuel pump.&nbsp; It is rare that these engines experience failure of the tubing and fittings 
	that transmit the pulses.&nbsp; Other types of engines (like the Top 80) have a port through the carburetor and the reed valve that goes to the engine crankcase.&nbsp; For the latter, incorrect installation of the gasket that goes 
	between the carburetor and the reed valve will cover the hole that goes to 
	the crankcase.&nbsp; The engine will still run, even without a fuel pump -- 
	but barely.&nbsp; As soon as the pilot goes to full throttle, the carburetor 
	is unable to deliver enough fuel to the engine and it leans out.&nbsp; 
	Another common cause is the overuse of sealants.&nbsp; More is not better.&nbsp; 
	The mating surfaces of the carburetor do not need any sealant, anyway.&nbsp; 
	However, pilots will goop everything up and the small port going to the 
	crankcase gets clogged and the pump fails.</p>
	<p>4. Incorrect jetting -- The WG-8 has a fixed main jet which works well at sea level but not at high altitudes (HA).&nbsp; If a pilot changes out the jet for a HA jet to fix a rich mixture at 
	above 4,000' MSL, then goes back to low altitude BUT forgets to put the original jet back in, he can quickly overheat his engine.&nbsp; On the other hand, the WB-37 used in some engines has an 
	adjustable main jet.&nbsp; Pilots who tinker with this adjustable jet are asking for trouble.&nbsp; Leave it alone unless you install a <a href="../CHT/cht.htm">CHT</a> and then ONLY make 
	adjustments by 1/8 turn or according to the instruction manual that came with the engine.</p>
	<p>Fuel starvation and ignition failure have common symptoms but must not be confused.&nbsp; The page on <a href="../performanceissues/performance_issues.htm">performance issues</a> will help solve many problems with the engine. </p>
