	<h1>Fuel Filters</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>If the best is desired, purchase the WIX #33001.&nbsp; It has at least a 5X greater filtering area than the OEM filter from Miniplane.&nbsp; Both are available from
	<a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/parts/tank.htm">Miniplane-USA</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not be tempted to buy an inline fuel filter at an auto parts store because they are almost always of inferior quality.</p>
	<h2>Filter quality &amp; capacity</h2>
	<p>Why bother with a high quality 
	filter?&nbsp; It must be able to trap all of the grit and other contaminants in the fuel and lubricating oil in order to prevent the carburetor from getting clogged.&nbsp; A clogged carburetor cannot 
	deliver the correct amount of fuel to the engine.</p>
	<p>A CLOGGED FUEL SYSTEM IN ANY HIGH PERFORMANCE ENGINE IS A POTENTIAL DISASTER.&nbsp; FUEL STARVATION IN THE TOP 80 IS THE #1 CAUSE OF ENGINE DAMAGE!</p>
	<p>Aviation engine forums (<a href="http://www.rotax-owner.com/rotax-forum/4-general-discussion/4587-fuel-filters-582">ROTAX</a>) 
	note that paper filters are the best because they have the finest filtration media  â€“  
	around 10 microns vs. 40+ micros for sintered bronze filters.&nbsp; The latter do not trap the very small particles which will clog the fuel 
	inlet screen and other tiny openings in the carburetor.&nbsp; A clear filter housing 
	must be used because pilots need to be able to periodically check that the 
	filter is not clogged.</p>
	<p>Here is a clogged fuel inlet screen from a Top 80 carburetor.&nbsp; Instead of using a quality filter, the pilot used a sintered bronze filter which allowed 
	contaminants to reach the carburetor.&nbsp; This engine experienced fuel starvation and overheated.&nbsp; Fortunately, it was not damaged because the lack of fuel was so severe the engine shut 
	down before damage could occur.</p>

	<p>Here is a sintered bronze filter.&nbsp; The dirt-bike guys derisively refer to these as "lawnmower engine filters" because of their inability to filter well.</p>

	<p>Below is a photo of the WIX inline fuel filter (L) and a similar 
	filter (R) sold by the auto parts stores.&nbsp; Note that the size of the 
	WIX filtering media is probably 10X that of the other.&nbsp; The 
	filter media of the WIX is 10 microns but who knows what it is of the filter 
	on the right.&nbsp; The absence of barbs on the hose connections guarantees 
	that the filter on the right will leak at some point.&nbsp; The barbs on the 
	WIX also ensure that the filter will not become easily disconnected from the 
	hoses -- which could be hazardous.&nbsp; Why put a cheap fuel filter on a $3,000 engine?&nbsp; Beats me....</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="WIX fuel filter and a poor quality inline fuel filter" src="DSCN3209_01.JPG" width="800" height="600"></p>
	<p>Depending on use, fuel filters should be replaced yearly.&nbsp; Ethanol and fuel that is contaminated by water hasten the deterioration of paper fuel filters.&nbsp; The in-tank 
	filter on the end of the fuel pickup hose should be checked to be sure it is 
	not clogged.&nbsp; Ethanol fuel blends can form gelatinous globs from contaminants 
	which will quickly clog the tank filter, so be 
	sure to check it often using the <a href="../fuelsystemtest.htm">quick fuel system test</a>.</p>
	<h2>Installation tips</h2>
	<p>To easily remove the fuel filter from the tubing, heat the tubing 
	with a hot air gun or a hair dryer until it is almost too hot to touch.&nbsp; 
	The tubing will easily slip right off of the fittings without damaging anything.</p>
	<p>When connecting the filter, put a small amount of pure silicone grease on the outlets and inside the tubing.&nbsp; This will greatly ease the installation of the tubing.&nbsp; It will also keep it from splitting.</p>
	<p>If the WIX filter is used, its large size has to be considered.&nbsp; The best location is just to the inside left of the right sidebar.&nbsp; Secure it with a long nylon zip tie.&nbsp; Use a 
	piece of black electrical tape (not shown) to keep the tie from slipping up or down on the filter.</p>
