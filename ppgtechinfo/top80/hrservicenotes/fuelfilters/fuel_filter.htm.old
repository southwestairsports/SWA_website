				<b><font size="5">Fuel Filters</font></b><br>

				The stock fuel filter supplied by Miniplane is not of 
				particularly good quality.&nbsp; I have repeatedly discovered 
				new filters on Top 80's that had external leaks due to casting 
				defects in the filter housing.&nbsp; Even the design of this 
				filter easily permits fuel to bypass the filter element.&nbsp; 
				This can be demonstrated by wiggling the top of the filter stem 
				when the engine is warmed up and running at idle: vapor/air/fuel 
				and who knows what else can be seen slipping right by the top of 
				the filter element and the clear plastic housing.&nbsp; I first 
				noticed this when I happened to see a stream of small bubbles 
				originating at the point of the red arrow in the photo below.<br>

				<br>
				Why have an inline fuel filter?&nbsp; I observed a Top 80 that 
				had the inline filter removed.&nbsp; It only had the filter 
				which is on the end of the pick-up tube in the fuel tank.&nbsp; 
				This engine was having severe performance problems.&nbsp; I 
				examined the fuel pump filter screen and it was clogged with 
				fine white particles that looked the same as the media inside 
				the filter on the end of the pick-up tube.&nbsp; The idle system 
				of the carburetor was also clogged with this white contaminant.&nbsp; 
				I cleaned everything out and installed an inline fuel filter.&nbsp; 
				This solved everything and the engine ran fine.<br>
				<br>
				Why bother with a high quality filter?&nbsp; If you plan to keep 
				your paramotor for years and put hundreds of hours on it, you 
				want to ensure that your filter is of the best quality.&nbsp; 
				This is because the fuel filter not only filters contaminants 
				out of the gasoline but also out of the lubricating oil.&nbsp; 
				Aviation engine forums (<a href="http://www.rotax-owner.com/rotax-forum/4-general-discussion/4587-fuel-filters-582">ROTAX</a>) 
				note that paper filters are the best because they have finer 
				filter media -- around 10 microns vs. 40 micros for sintered 
				bronze filters. The downside of the paper filters is that they 
				clog more easily.&nbsp; This is not a problem with paramotors 
				because their fuel rate consumption is so low, the fuel systems 
				are simple with no metal parts that can corrode, and the filter 
				is easily visible and can be regularly checked.<br>
				<br>
				I have done some research and found this
				<a href="http://www.wixfilters.com/Lookup/PartDetails.aspx?Part=33001">
				high quality inline filter</a> made by WIX.&nbsp; It has a 
				nominal 12 microns filtering capacity.&nbsp; It is slightly 
				larger diameter (+1/2&quot;) than the stock Miniplane filter.&nbsp; 
				The cost is around $4 from Amazon.<br>
				<br>

				<br>
				Most will not need to bother about having the cleanest fuel and 
				oil going into the engine.&nbsp; But if you fly a lot with the 
				same paramotor why not have the best fuel filter you can find?<br>
				<br>
				Miniplane cannot be relied on to ensure that their engines come 
				stock with the necessary parts to make them safer or last 
				longer.&nbsp; For years (now corrected) they did not supply new 
				motors with the copper manifold gasket that prevented the 
				exhaust manifold pipe from wearing a deep hole in the cylinder 
				head after extended use (+100 hours).&nbsp; Similarly, every 
				paramotor should have an engine hour-meter and tachometer but 
				this is not even an option on new Miniplanes.&nbsp; What about 
				the lack of a choke cable on the new Thor 130?&nbsp; This is not 
				only an inconvenience but a safety issue.&nbsp; The flimsy 
				buckle system that holds the frame up while doing the launch 
				run?&nbsp; These routinely break -- and Miniplane still has not 
				fixed this defect.&nbsp; There have been serious accidents 
				caused by the failure of the bolt that attaches the ABM side 
				bars to the frame.&nbsp; There should be a safety strap here so 
				that a failure is not catastrophic.&nbsp; This is a <i>major 
				safety issue</i> with the Miniplane frame.<br>
				<br>
				I think everyone can see that there are simple and inexpensive 
				ways to make a paramotor safer and last longer.<br>
