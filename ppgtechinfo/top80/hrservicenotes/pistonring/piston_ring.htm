	<h1>Piston ring problems</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>Like everything else in an engine, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piston_ring">piston rings</a> can wear out and/or be damaged.&nbsp; Below is a close-up photo of a Top 80 ring from a 
	new engine that had no lubrication for a brief period.&nbsp; The pilot had fuel that was contaminated with water (he sent me a sample).&nbsp; However, he may have forgotten to mix oil with the 
	gasoline, despite his claims to the contrary.&nbsp; Typical when lubrication is lost, the piston in the engine will seize from overheating, as this one probably did.</p>
	<p>The piston ring is necessary to seal the combustion chamber and to transfer heat from the piston to the cylinder walls.</p>
	<p>A new ring is on the left, the damaged ring is on the right.&nbsp; Notice that the chromium/nitride plating is missing from the outer edges of the ring (red arrows) and the cast iron core of 
	the ring is exposed and badly worn.&nbsp; Instead of relatively sharp outer edges, the ring is slightly rounded and is unable to do its job of sealing the combustion chamber.</p>
	<p>The black arrow shows what is left of the badly scuffed plating.&nbsp; If the pilot had run the engine a bit more, there would have been nothing left of the plating.&nbsp; When 
	lubrication is lost while the engine is running, cylinder, piston, and piston ring wear is severe and all of the components must be replaced.&nbsp; A damaged cylinder can be replaced or 
	re-bored/honed at <a href="http://www.rb-designs.com/rb_designs_llc_007.htm">this shop</a> for a modest price and get an oversized piston from Miniplane-USA, if needed.</p>
