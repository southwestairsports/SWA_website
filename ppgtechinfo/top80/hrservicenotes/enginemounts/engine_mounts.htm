	<h1>Engine Mounts</h1>
	<p>The rubber engine mounts on all paramotors are normal, perishable items.&nbsp; 
	That is, they have a limited life and will fail after so many hours, usually 
	around (50) depending on the size of the engine.&nbsp; Some mounts may only 
	last about (10) hours.&nbsp; If pilots replace these 
	mounts with the heavy duty
	<a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/pages/viking.htm">Viking PPG Poly 
	Motor Mounts</a>, they must be CERTAIN that the new mounts do not touch any 
	parts on the motor!</p>
	<p>The following Polini Thor 130 suffered a catastrophic failure of the 
	starter where it separated from the motor while the pilot was in the air.</p>
	<p>What had happened was the pilot had installed the Viking mounts but 
	did not check the clearance from one of the mounts to one of the starter 
	mounting tabs.&nbsp; The severe vibration of the motor caused the starter 
	tab to start wearing down the mount.&nbsp; But after a while, the forces 
	were so great that they caused the starter screws to shear where they 
	entered the screw holes on the engine.&nbsp; Two screws sheared off and the 
	third had its threads stripped.</p>

	<p>On the Polini engines, pilots must grind down the lower left mount so that 
	it does not touch the starter mounting tabs.&nbsp; A 1/4 inch clearance should be 
	sufficient.</p>
	<p>Modifications to engines, in general, must be thoroughly 
	reviewed and checked for potential problems like this one.&nbsp; One thing 
	is common to all paramotors:&nbsp; They all vibrate severely, especially the 
	larger engines.&nbsp; As a result, motor mounts should be checked routinely 
	and replaced promptly.&nbsp; Pilots can use heavy duty nylon zip ties to 
	prevent the engine from moving away from the frame if a mount breaks.&nbsp; 
	Some engines have a nylon webbing strap for the this purpose. &nbsp;</p>
