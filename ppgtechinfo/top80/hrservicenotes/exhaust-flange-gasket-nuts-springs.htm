	<h1>Exhaust flange gasket, nuts, springs, and studs</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<h2>How to tighten exhaust manifold nuts on the springs</h2>
	<h3>Quick ref</h3>
	<p>Length, new spring: 12mm<br>Length, minimum: 9.5mm<br>Adjustment, ideal: 1.7mm (0.066") between widest coil<br>Adjustment, minimum: 0.5mm (0.020") between widest coil.<br>Note: If gasket leaks 
	when set to minimum spring adjustment or less, spring must be replaced.</p>
	<h3>Spring adjustment -- detail</h3>
	<p>Tools needed: (1) metric/U.S. feeler gauge.&nbsp; No feeler gauge has a blade that is 1.7mm (0.066") thick.&nbsp; To get around this, double-up adjacent blades so that you can get within a few 
	thousandths of the needed value.&nbsp; Remember: it is always better to have the spring tension too little than too much.</p>
	<p>New exhaust manifold springs are about 12mm in length.&nbsp; Used springs 
	should be at least 9.5mm in length.&nbsp; If they are shorter than this, the 
	springs will not be able to do their job -- buy new ones.&nbsp; Pilots routinely over-tighten these springs and ruin them.&nbsp; Just in case nuts were provided that are not the locking type (or  
	are worn out) put a drop of blue threadlock on the studs about 14mm out from the 
	cylinder head before installing the nuts.</p>
	<p>New springs that have not been previously over-tightened should be tightened so that there is a space of 1.7mm (0.066") between the widest coil.&nbsp; This value is usually sufficient to stop 
	oil leaks with new springs.</p>
	<p>As the springs age or have been over-tightened, this space needs to be decreased in order to keep the correct amount of tension so that the manifold does not leak.&nbsp; The minimum space 
	between the widest coil must not be less than 0.5mm (0.020").&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tighten the nuts ONLY enough to stop leaks.&nbsp; If there are leaks, tighten the nuts a 1/4 turn at a time but do 
	not allow the space to be less than the 0.5mm minimum.&nbsp; However, the manifold gasket will always leak just a little but it should not drip copiously.&nbsp; If it does, the gasket is defective or 
	improperly installed.&nbsp; Further tightening of the nuts will not 
	help.&nbsp; Replace the springs and the gasket if leaks still occur after the nuts are correctly tightened.</p>
	<p>WARNING: The tighter the exhaust springs, the shorter the life of the gasket and the more strain that is put on the exhaust system from engine vibration.&nbsp; This is why it is best to only tighten them as needed.&nbsp; If the springs are compressed too tightly, the 
	steel exhaust pipe will crack the soft copper manifold gasket.&nbsp; A cracked/bent gasket will leak no matter how tight the springs are compressed.</p>
	<h2>Exhaust manifold gasket</h2>
	<p>The exhaust manifold gasket will eventually split/crack after many hours (100+) and must 
	be checked periodically.&nbsp; When changing out the gasket, install it with 
	gray RTV sealant or equivalent on the side that is towards the cylinder.&nbsp; 
	Clean both surfaces thoroughly with brake cleaner.&nbsp; Be sure to stuff the exhaust port with tissue in order to keep the brake cleaner out of the cylinder.&nbsp; After applying the sealant, remove the excess sealant that is INSIDE the exhaust port.&nbsp; Excess sealant that oozed to the outside does 
	no harm and can be left.</p>
	<h2>Manifold studs</h2>
	<p>The studs in the cylinder head must be installed with red (high strength) 
	threadlock to the proper torque (see the <a href="specsTop80.htm">SPEC page</a>).&nbsp; I have noticed that Miniplane is now using tempered steel (black) studs which are installed with threadlock.&nbsp; 
	These will last much longer and will not break as easily as the commonly used stainless steel studs.&nbsp; 
	Always check to be sure these studs are torqued properly, regardless.&nbsp; LOOSE STUDS WILL RUIN WHATEVER THEY ARE SCREWED IN TO!</p>
