	<h1>Squish adjustment</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson with assistance from Gale Tyler</p>
	<blockquote><em>Squish is an effect in internal combustion engines which creates sudden turbulence of the fuel/air mixture as the piston approaches top dead center (TDC).&nbsp; In an engine 
	designed to use the squish effect, at top dead center (TDC) the piston crown comes very close, (typically less than 1mm, to the cylinder head. The gases are suddenly "squished" out within the 
	combustion chamber, creating turbulence which promotes thorough fuel/air mixing, a factor beneficial to efficient combustion.</em> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squish_(piston_engine)">
	from Wiki</a></blockquote>
	<p><img alt="squish band in a piston engine - from Wiki" class="auto-style1" height="223" src="Squish_band.svg.png" width="220"></p>
	<p>Squish is the clearance between the piston and the squish band inside the cylinder (see illustration).&nbsp; Squish is very important because high squish velocity shortens combustion duration, staving off 
	detonation (knocking/pre-ignition).&nbsp; If it is not set correctly, the engine can be damaged.&nbsp; The squish is adjusted by changing the thickness of the gasket that is between the base of 
	the cylinder and the engine crankcase.</p>
	<p>Typical for the Top 80 is the loosening of the cylinder head nuts caused by detonation from the squish being set incorrectly, namely, having too little squish which effectively increases the 
	compression ratio.</p>
	<p>There is no reason to check the squish unless you have 
	disassembled the engine or suspect a problem (pre-ignition/detonation/knocking).&nbsp; 
	You should NEVER reuse any of the engine gaskets which is why you must check 
	the squish every time you remove the cylinder from the engine.</p>
	<p>It is always prudent to order additional gaskets one size larger and one size smaller.&nbsp; Measure the thickness of the gaskets with a caliper (under $20 for a digital caliber from Harbor 
	Freight).&nbsp; Write the values on the gaskets with a pencil.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;The motorcycle, go-kart, Jet-Ski, and dirtbike guys are some of the best experts on this topic.&nbsp; Here is <a href="http://www.gasgasrider.org/html/measuring_squish.html">helpful 
	article</a> that gives more information on squish and how to measure it very accurately.&nbsp; Because most pilots do not plan to modify their engines, I do not think that the steps given to 
	measure squish in this article are necessary.</p>
	<h2>Needed special tools</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Rosin core solder  –  
	available at Radio Shack or Harbor Freight.&nbsp; DO NOT USE SOLID CORE SOLDER!<br></li>
		<li>Caliper  –  The cheap digital calipers available at Harbor Freight are sufficient</li>
		<li>Cylinder gaskets – If you are going to do this project, you can order in advance a selection of the common sizes.&nbsp; I have never used a 0.20mm gasket.&nbsp; The common sizes are:&nbsp; 0.30mm and 
		0.40mm.&nbsp; You should always measure the thickness of the received gasket and write the value with a pencil on the gasket itself.&nbsp; Gasket thickness can vary up to 0.06mm either direction.</li>
		<li>Torque wrench  –  if you need a torque 
	wrench and do not have one, you probably should not be doing this project 
		in the first place.&nbsp; Get some help and/or educate yourself about working 
		on small engines before tackling projects like this.</li>
		<li>Cylinder head "O" ring.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>To measure the existing squish</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Make a (2) strand "rope" of ordinary rosin-core solder about 4" long.&nbsp; 
	The rope must be tight (10-25 turns/inch).&nbsp; Making a rope makes it 
	easier to measure the thickness of the squished solder.</li>
		<li>Remove the spark plug.</li>
		<li>Insert the solder so that it touches 
	the wall of the cylinder, where the squish band is.</li>
		<li>Gently pull on the starter so that the piston 
	goes past TDC at least twice.&nbsp; Never pull on the starter quickly unless 
		the spark plug is connected to the secondary wire and is GROUNDED to the engine because you might burn 
	out the ignition coil.</li>
		<li>Remove the solder and measure the 
		solder thickness (the squish).&nbsp; The very tip (0.1mm) of the squished solder will be thicker because of the clearance between the edge of the piston and the cylinder wall.&nbsp; Do not measure 
		the tip but just inside it.&nbsp; It should be within the values given on our
		<a href="../specsTop80.htm">specification page</a>.&nbsp; Note that engines made before June 2003 have a different value.</li>
		<li>Reinstall the spark plug and torque to the proper value.&nbsp; Getting the spacing correct is important if you want your engine to reach full power but not experience destructive 
		pre-ignition (detonation/knocking).</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>To determine 
	the correct size of gasket to use</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Remove the cylinder.<br></li>
		<li>Remove the old cylinder head gasket, if necessary, and then reassemble the cylinder WITHOUT A CYLINDER HEAT GASKET.&nbsp;&nbsp; Properly torque down the cylinder head nuts to specifications (8 Nm).<br></li>
		<li>Measure the squish again per the above.<br></li>
		<li>Subtract the measured value 
	from the specified value.&nbsp; The difference will be the thickness of the 
	gasket needed.&nbsp; However, the 
	gasket will compress when the cylinder head is torqued down.&nbsp; Gaskets compress 25% - 30% of the uncompressed (unused) value and this must be calculated when determining the gasket thickness.&nbsp; For example, if 0.30mm of additional 
		spacing is needed, install 
	a gasket that, before compression, is 0.38mm thick.&nbsp; In this example, use a 0.40mm gasket because a 0.38mm is not available.&nbsp; It is always safer to have too much spacing than too little so choose a 
	gasket of the next greater thickness, if ever in doubt.<br></li>
		<li>Reinstall the cylinder head with the correct gasket.&nbsp; Sealant is NOT needed on 
	the cylinder gasket. Install the cylinder head WITHOUT THE "O" RING, torque it down to specifications, and measure the spacing again.&nbsp; If it is within specifications, then remove the 
		cylinder head and install it with the "O" ring with RTV sealant. Torque to specifications. It is prudent to use a small amount of RTV "blue" type gasket sealant on the "O" ring, if the 
		cylinder head was removed.&nbsp; Put the sealant between your fingers and pull the "O" ring through your fingers.&nbsp; Do NOT use too much sealant.&nbsp; You only need to just coat the "O" ring.&nbsp; More is 
		NOT better.&nbsp; Sealant should be used because there may be slight deformities or nicks in the top of the cylinder or head and the RTV sealant will take care of it.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Let the engine sit (8) 
	hours for the sealant to cure.&nbsp; Replace the spark plug WITH the spacer.&nbsp; 
	You should be good to go.&nbsp; Remember that too much cylinder head/piston spacing is better than too little.</p>
