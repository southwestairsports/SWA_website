	<h1>Secondary wire permanent replacement</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>When this repair is completed, pilots will immediately notice an improvement in the high end performance of their engines.</p>
	<p>If a temporary 
	repair is preferred, go to
	<a href="../troubleshooting/elecltroubleshooting.htm">this page</a> for instructions.&nbsp; Here is the <a href="../secwirereplold/sec_repl.htm" target="_blank">old technique</a> used to make a permanent repair 
	of the secondary wire, if needed.</p>
	<p>This repair is much easier to do than removing the engine from the frame, taking the front apart, replacing the finger screws, re-timing the engine, etc.&nbsp; What is worse, if you replace the whole 
	coil assembly, it will fail soon enough, just like the original, and you will have to do it again ... and again ... and again....</p>
	<p>It is extremely rare that the coil itself is bad.&nbsp; Instead, the secondary wire 
	fails.</p>
	<p>In order to not waste your time and money, check the coil to be sure it is good.&nbsp; Stick a sharp needle into the secondary wire about 3" from the coil in order to determine the resistance to the engine ground 
	e.g. one of the aluminum cooling fins on the cylinder.&nbsp; 
	It should 
	be 
	about 10K Ohms (the resistance of a good coil plus the resistance of 3" of secondary wire on a Top 80 -- other engines may vary).&nbsp; If you do not see any resistance at first, withdraw the needle and stick it in again close by 
	and towards the coil.&nbsp; If it is less than 10% of 10K Ohms (or open/infinite) in a Top 80 coil, the entire coil assembly must be 
	replaced.</p>
	<p>Pilots should also check the <a href="../troubleshooting/elecltroubleshooting.htm#Primary_Wire" target="_blank">primary 
	wire</a> just to be sure it is OK.&nbsp; It is open, the kill switch will not function.</p>
	<p>Small two cycle aviation engines all have a low flywheel mass to save weight.&nbsp; Consequently they all experience severe and damaging vibration.&nbsp; This leads to early failure of engine 
	components, including the secondary ignition wire that goes from the coil to the spark plug.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Miniplane OEM supplier (IDM) uses an inexpensive secondary wire that breaks 
	and then burns out 
	quickly.&nbsp; The core is made up of a carbon impregnated sheath surrounding hundreds of tiny flexible synthetic fibers that give it strength.&nbsp; In tests 
	done here it is easy to break the Top 80 carbon sheath with modest flexing.&nbsp; Premium grade secondary wire does not use a carbon core but has a spirally wound wire core.&nbsp; 
	This type of core will generally last the life of the engine.</p>

	<p>In the photo below, the spiral core of the new secondary wire is exposed.&nbsp; Instead of a thin film of carbon surrounding the fibers of the inner core, it is wrapped with special wire that is much more 
	durable than a carbon film.&nbsp; The resistance of this wire is 155 ohms/ft. compared to a carbon core wire which has a resistance of about 6.8K Ohms/ft.&nbsp; The spiral wrap also suppresses 
	ignition interference with two-way radios.</p>

	<p>Replacing the entire coil assembly, on the other hand, is a time consuming job, advanced technical skills, and costs at least four times more than just replacing the secondary wire.</p>
	<h2>Replacing the secondary wire</h2>
	<p>This repair should take less than an hour to complete.</p>
	<p><strong>Special tools needed</strong> -- 1500 Watt Dual Temperature <a href="../../../toolkit/paramotor_essential_toolkit.htm" target="_blank">Heat Gun</a> (572°/1112° or better); a digital multimeter.&nbsp; If you need help 
	on how to use a digital multimeter, Fluke has
	<a href="http://en-us.fluke.com/training/training-library/test-tools/digital-multimeters/how-to-measure-resistance.html" target="_blank">instructions here</a> on how to measure resistance.</p>

	</ul>
	<p><img alt="top 80 secondary wire repair" height="480" src="DSCN5514_01.JPG" width="640">&nbsp;</p>
	<p>With this fix, there is a remote chance that the new wire may cause unacceptable interference in some 2-way radios.&nbsp; If that is the case, change the spark plug to a resistor type e.g. NGK 
	BR9ES or BR9EG (cold flying conditions) or NGK BR10ES or BR10EG (hot flying conditions).&nbsp; However, I have tested the replacement wire with an ordinary FM VHF two-way radio and could not hear 
	any ignition noise.&nbsp; No matter what wire or type of spark plug is used, VHF AM aviation band radios will not work near a Top 80 (or any paramotor) unless the ignition system is completely and 
	tightly shielded.</p>
	<p>Read through this section completely before beginning the actual repair.&nbsp; Take a look at this video for some <a href="https://youtu.be/9rWbqVx5vNQ" target="_blank">tips on the process</a>.&nbsp; 
	The video only shows the major steps.</p>
	<p>1. Remove the holding clamps from the old secondary wire -- The clamp on the cooling air duct is held with a plastic screw.&nbsp; When replacing the clamp later, it is best to use a small metal screw 
	for reattaching the clamp rather than the OEM plastic screw.&nbsp; You will need a drill and a 1/8" bit to remove the rivet that attaches the second clamp to the cooling box.&nbsp; Drill the head 
	of the rivet just enough so that the head pops off.&nbsp; Remove the clamp and push the rest of the rivet through the cooling box with a nail.&nbsp; Find a small bolt and nut to reattach the 
	clamp later.&nbsp; Be sure to use threadlock on the bolt and nut or it will loosen!</p>
	<p>2. Remove the old wire from the coil -- Using a razor blade, slice the existing piece of heat shrinkable tubing (HST) lengthwise where it surrounds the old wire at coil.&nbsp; 
	Peel off the old HST.&nbsp; Using the hot air gun at the low setting, heat up the area where the wire enters the coil (see the 1st segment of the video).&nbsp; As you heat the area, gently pull on the wire.&nbsp; It 
	should take about a minute for things to get hot enough for the old glue to melt and the old wire to be pulled out.</p>
	<p><strong>Don't get things too hot!</strong>&nbsp; If there is any smoke coming from the area, back 
	off the gun from the area but continue to pull gently on the wire.&nbsp; If things get too hot, the high tension terminal housing and the internal connections could be damaged!</p>
	<p>Once the wire is removed, check the resistance of the coil.&nbsp; If it is not 8.5K Ohms +-10%, you will have to <a href="../ignition-coil/ignition-coil.htm" target="_blank">replace the coil</a>.</p>
	<p><img alt="Top 80 ignition coil being tested" height="768" src="DSCN5482_01.JPG" width="1024"></p>
	<p>3.&nbsp; Secure the  
	boot end of the new wire to the top of the engine near the spark plug hole with a piece of masking tape.&nbsp; This must be done so that there will not be any tugging on the end of the new wire 
	while you are attaching it to the coil.&nbsp; If you attach the new wire to the spark plug you will just have to remove it again when you test the resistance of the new secondary wire before 
	curing the HST.&nbsp; There is also a significant chance you will yank things if the boot is attached to the spark plug.</p>
	<p>Slide the large piece of HST onto the new wire.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p><img alt="top 80 secondary wire repair" height="480" src="DSCN5515_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>Next, slide the small piece of HST (white arrow) over the exposed core at the end of the new wire.&nbsp; The photos below are with the coil off the engine for the sake of clarity.</p>
	<p><img alt="top 80 secondary wire repair" height="480" src="DSCN5516_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>Gently push the wire into the high tension socket on the coil so that the barbed steel post slips inside the small piece of HST and solidly touches the core of the wire.&nbsp; You will know you 
	have done it correctly if you can very gently pull on the wire and it does not pull out.&nbsp; The wire must be completely inserted into the socket and none of the core should be showing.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p><img alt="top 80 secondary wire repair" height="480" src="DSCN5517_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>4.&nbsp;Test the resistance of the new wire -- You MUST check the resistance of the new wire assembly before you make the joint permanent to be certain that the new wire and the coil are 
	electrically connected together.&nbsp; With the multimeter, measure the resistance of the wire from the spark plug terminal inside the boot to a cooling fin on the engine.&nbsp; The resistance 
	should be 8.8K Ohms +-10% for the Top 80.&nbsp; Other engines may have a different value.</p>
	<p>5. Slide the big piece of HST over the high tension terminal on the 
	coil.</p>
	<p><img alt="top 80 secondary wire repair" height="480" src="DSCN5518_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>Apply low heat with the gun, moving the gun back and forth over the HST.</p>
	<p>As you apply heat, you will see the HST start to shrink around the terminal and the wire.&nbsp; Because the adhesive is slippery when hot, the HST will tend to slide off the socket as it shrinks.&nbsp; 
	You must use a popsicle stick or a pencil to hold the HST in place while it is being cured.</p>
	<p>Keep applying heat until you see the adhesive ooze out of the ends 
	of the HST.&nbsp; When this happens, STOP APPLYING HEAT IMMEDIATELY.&nbsp; Continue to hold the HST in place for at least one minute after heat is removed.&nbsp; If the HST has moved off the socket a bit, you can push it back on and hold it.</p>
	<p>Do NOT move ANYTHING until everything cools down completely.&nbsp; It can take a full minute or more.</p>
	<p>The adhesive in the HST will firmly grab the new wire and 
	hold it on to the high tension terminal as well as seal the connection from water, oil, and dirt.&nbsp; If you make a mistake, we can send you a new piece of the special HST for $5 shipping included.</p>
	<p>Below is a photo of the how the completed connection should look like.</p>
	<p><img alt="top 80 secondary wire repair" height="480" src="DSCN5519_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>6. Check the resistance of the new wire to ground.&nbsp; It should be around 10K Ohms for the Top 80.&nbsp; Other engines may have a different value.</p>
	<p><img alt="checking the resistance of the secondary wire and coil" height="960" src="DSCN5492_01.JPG" width="1280"></p>
	<p>7. Reattach the secondary wire to the engine cowling and the cooling box using the clamps.&nbsp; THIS MUST BE DONE or the new wire may be destroyed by the intense vibrations of the engine.</p>
	<p>8. Attach the boot to the spark plug.&nbsp; The boot should be gently twisted and pushed down over the plug.&nbsp; The boot is correctly seated when the gap between the bottom of the boot and 
	metal base of the plug is about 1/8" (4mm).&nbsp; If the boot is not correctly attached, the engine vibration will destroy the internals of the new spark plug boot.</p>
	<p>The completed installation.&nbsp; This fix for the secondary wire uses the same method of fastening the wire as the factory but the components are of superior quality.&nbsp; If you accidently damage the spark plug boot, we have the original replacements.&nbsp; Please <a href="../../../../ContactUs/contactus.htm">contact us</a> to order.&nbsp; 
	I welcome suggestions to improve this repair.&nbsp; Other pilots will benefit.</p>
