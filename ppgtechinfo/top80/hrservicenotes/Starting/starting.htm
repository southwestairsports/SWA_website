	<h1>Priming &amp; starting the engine</h1>
	<p>By Had Robinson</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Here is how to prime the engine so it will start the first pull – every time.&nbsp; This technique will NOT flood the engine!&nbsp; Pilots must be able to easily position the inlet side of the 
	carburetor lower than outlet side.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; With engines where the carburetor is mounted vertically, a slightly different technique must be used -- see below.</p>
	<p>A flooded engine 
	will take a lot of pulling on the starter to clear things up.&nbsp; It may 
	be so flooded that the engine will have to have the carburetor and reed 
	valve removed in order to drain out the accumulated fuel and oil.&nbsp; I 
	have actually seen this happen.&nbsp; Frustrated pilots routinely damage 
	their starters trying to start flooded engines.</p>
	<p>Additionally, using this 
	technique will also tell pilots that the fuel system 
	is in good condition.&nbsp; (Go
	here to get <a href="../fuelsystemtest.htm">more info</a> on how to easily test 
	the fuel system.)</p>
	<p>No engine will start easily unless the <a href="../troubleshooting/elecltroubleshooting.htm">ignition</a> and/or
	<a href="../walbrowg8/low_speed_adjustment.htm">carburetor adjustments</a> are in order so be sure these are OK first.&nbsp; The <a href="../walbrowg8/low_speed_adjustment.htm">low speed idle adjustment</a> is precise 
	and needs to be accurate for the engine to start or run smoothly midrange.&nbsp; 
	A broken core in the secondary wire, a fouled, old, or loose spark plug, or bad/old fuel will 
	always make the engine hard to start.</p>
	<p>Pilots who become skilled with this technique can start their paramotor 
	with it on their backs.&nbsp; This is always a much SAFER option than 
	starting it on the ground.</p>
	<blockquote><span class="italics">Note: If pilots must start the engine on 
		the ground, ALWAYS put the throttle hand on the engine frame in such a way that 
	the sudden start of the motor does not cause the throttle 
		to open accidently!<br><br>BE CERTAIN THAT THE THROTTLE IS IN YOUR HAND 
	WITH YOUR THUMB READY ON THE KILL BUTTON!<br><br>A run-away paramotor is 
	both terrifying and dangerous and pilots must always be ready to shut it down.&nbsp; (Don't ask how I know this....)&nbsp; 
	Kill switches can fail.&nbsp; This is why newer pilots should use their 
	glider strap or a line to tie the propeller to the cage until they get 
	thoroughly familiar with their engine.&nbsp; 
		<a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/parts/propeller.htm">Miniplane-USA</a> supplies  
	propeller covers with a strap for this purpose.&nbsp; None of this is necessary, 
		however, if the engine is started while on the back.</span></blockquote>
	<h2>How to start the engine with the first 
	pull, every time</h2>
	<ol>
		<li class="il-padding-dot2em">This technique is only good for about <strong>(5) minutes</strong> because the fuel will evaporate and the prime will be lost.&nbsp; Modify the times 
		given in the steps below for your particular engine, as needed.</li>
		<li class="il-padding-dot2em">Facing the rear of the engine, <span class="bold">Tilt</span> 
			the paramotor to the right about 20 degrees so that the intake of the carburetor is just pointing 
			down from the engine side.&nbsp; If 
		this is not done, the engine will flood.&nbsp; The principle is that extra fuel will run 
			harmlessly OUT of the carburetor instead of INTO the engine, flooding it.&nbsp; However, do not tilt it excessively because you want some fuel to be present in and about the carburetor throat.</li>
		<li class="il-padding-dot2em"><span class="bold">Blow</span> into the primer tube on the fuel tank 
			so it is pressurized.&nbsp; Use the tip of the tongue to hold the pressure.</li>
		<li class="il-padding-dot2em"><span class="bold">Push down</span> on the priming lever on the carburetor 
		for 6-8 seconds.&nbsp; (For the Minari and others with a vertical carburetor, hold the primer lever down about 1-2 seconds.&nbsp; It is easy to flood these types of engines.)&nbsp; Some engines may require more time (10-15 seconds) to get fuel into the carburetor.&nbsp; (If there is no priming lever, contact
		<a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/parts/carb.htm">
		Miniplane USA</a> to order one.)&nbsp; Bubbles, if there 
		are any, will be seen making their way to the 
			carburetor through the transparent fuel line and fuel filter.&nbsp; Hold the lever (and fuel tank pressure) until ALL air/vapor bubbles in the fuel line go 
			into the carburetor and then hold it another (4-7) seconds.&nbsp; If the priming lever is held down too long, causing fuel to go everywhere, it does not matter because the fuel will harmlessly 
		accumulate in the airbox and/or run out of it.&nbsp; The engine will not flood.&nbsp; Most pilots do not prime the engine long enough.<br><br><img alt="WG8 carburetor priming lever" height="480" src="DSCN5042_01.JPG" width="640"><br>&nbsp;<br>If 
		the air box is removed, fuel will dribble out 
			of the carburetor.&nbsp; If it does not, you know you have a fuel system problem and the engine will never start until it is fixed.&nbsp; If the air box is on the engine, the excess fuel will 
			harmlessly accumulate in the air box and evaporate as the engine is 
		run.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp;the fuel filter will always have some air/fuel vapor in it.&nbsp; It rarely means that there is a fuel system leak.<br><br>THE ENGINE MUST BE STARTED WITHIN ABOUT 5 MINUTES OR THE PREVIOUS 
		STEPS MUST BE REPEATED.&nbsp; THIS IS BECAUSE THE FUEL WILL EVAPORATE 
		FROM THE CARBURETOR THROAT AND AIRBOX AND THE PRIME WILL BE LOST.</li>
		<li class="il-padding-dot2em"><span class="bold">No choke</span>  –  do not 
			use the choke.&nbsp; It is unnecessary if the engine is primed 
	correctly.&nbsp; When this technique for starting the engine is mastered, 
		the choke is not used except to stop the engine in an emergency 
		(failed kill switch), to start it mid-air after the engine has been stopped for 5-10 minutes or more, or you are unable to prime the engine for some reason.</li>
		<li class="il-padding-dot2em"><span class="bold">Put the paramotor on 
		your back</span>.&nbsp; This is optional.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to start it while it is on the ground and always safer to start it on your back.</li>
		<li class="il-padding-dot2em"><span class="bold">Slowly turn</span> the 
		engine over 3-4 times with the starter.&nbsp; It takes little 
		effort if done slowly enough.&nbsp; This will charge the crankcase and cylinder 
		with the fuel/air mixture.</li>
		<li class="il-padding-dot2em"><span class="bold">Open the throttle</span> 
		about one quarter and pull slowly on the starter rope until the 
		compression stroke of the engine is just felt.</li>
		<li class="il-padding-dot2em"><span class="bold">Pull smartly</span> on the starter.&nbsp; 
		NEVER YANK IT!&nbsp; 
	Twenty-five pounds of force or less is more than enough force.&nbsp; Do not pull so far that the starter cord is pulled all the way to the end.&nbsp; If 
		it is pulled to the end 
	regularly, full strength used, the pull handle yanked, or pulled 
	repeatedly, the starter may be destroyed or worn out prematurely.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The engine should start 
	immediately whether it is hot or cold.&nbsp; If it does not start the first pull, you probably did not prime it long enough.&nbsp; It may take a few times for you to master the idiosyncrasies of 
	your carburetor/engine combination.</p>
	<p>Remember that a badly flooded engine may have to have the spark plug and air box removed, 
	the throttle tied open, and an hour to sit for things 
	to dry out.&nbsp; This can happen if step #1 above is not done correctly.</p>
	<p>If a pilot is careful, the starter 
	will also last much longer  –  even the life of the engine.&nbsp; I have never had to replace a starter on any of my Miniplane engines, only 
	the cord after a few hundred hours of use.</p>
