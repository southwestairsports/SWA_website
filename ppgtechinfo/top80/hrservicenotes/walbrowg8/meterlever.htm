	<h1>Fuel Metering Lever on the WG-8 carburetor</h1>
	<p>(taken off line 6-20-14  â€“  not accurate)</p>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>The down movement of the metering lever diaphragm is 
	limited by an outer metal skirt that surrounds the center button on the 
	diaphragm.&nbsp; If the metering lever gets bent, the carburetor can starve 
	the engine of fuel under high load conditions.&nbsp; This is because the 
	free travel of the diaphragm is restricted by design and it cannot push the 
	bent lever down far enough to deliver enough fuel at higher loads.&nbsp; The 
	engine may run at partial loads but when WOT (wide open throttle) is 
	engaged, it may sputter or die.<br><br>Owners of the WG-8 must be careful 
	when priming the carburetor.&nbsp; It is better not to press on the 
	diaphragm at all unless it is equipped with the special priming lever now 
	supplied on all Top 80 carburetors.&nbsp; If your carburetor does not have 
	this special accessory to prime it, then it is safer to prime it the old 
	fashioned way:&nbsp;crank the motor with full choke until the fuel pump gets fuel 
	into the carburetor.&nbsp; Better, first remove the fuel line at the 
	carburetor and pressurize the fuel tank by blowing on the priming tube.&nbsp; 
	This will fill the fuel lines with fuel.&nbsp; Quickly reattach the fuel 
	line to the carburetor while holding some pressure in the fuel tank.&nbsp; 
	Another option is to purchase the Miniplane priming lever kit from us.<br>To 
	see if you bent your metering lever, remove the cover plate and measure the 
	distance from the top of the carburetor housing to the top of the fuel 
	metering lever (where it contacts the button on the diaphragm).&nbsp; This 
	distance should be 1.7mm (the height that all carburetors have when new from 
	the factory).<br><br>To verify that this is the correct height, I opened up 
	a WG-8 on a brand new Top 80 and measured the metering lever height.&nbsp; 
	It was 1.7mm.&nbsp; This also agrees with the preset height of the metering 
	lever supplied in the Walbro rebuild kits for the WG-8.<br><br>However, the 
	official Miniplane service manual states that it should be 0.5mm<span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:

mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"> -
	</span>0.7mm.&nbsp; 
	Why would a new WG-8 come from the Miniplane factory with a metering lever 
	height of 1.7mm when it is supposed to be 1mm less?<br><br>Our experience 
	has been that the difference between 0.7mm and 1.7mm is not that important.&nbsp; 
	The diaphragm has a great range of movement and its function would only be 
	affected if the metering lever height is significantly outside 
	specifications.&nbsp; The surface area of the diaphragm does not change, 
	regardless of the metering lever height.&nbsp; (The
	<a href="MeteringLeverIssues.pdf">tech note</a> from someone at Walbro failed to mention this important fact.)&nbsp; 
	The critical value is the pop-off spring tension because this and the main 
	jet are what determine the fuel/air ratio that enters the engine.&nbsp; If 
	you increase the height more than 1.7mm (by forcing the metering lever 
	diaphragm down with some tool), the diaphragm will bottom out on the 
	carburetor housing and starve the engine at high loads.&nbsp; If the 
	metering lever is much lower than 0.7mm, it will force the inlet needle valve open 
	even when the engine is off and flood it.<br><br>In conclusion, it is safer 
	for the engine to have a lesser than a greater height because there is less 
	chance of it running too lean.&nbsp; I am continuing to experiment with all 
	of this and will post any changes here.&nbsp;</p>
