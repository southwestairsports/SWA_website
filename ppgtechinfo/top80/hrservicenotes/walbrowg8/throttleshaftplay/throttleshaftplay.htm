	<h1>Throttle Shaft Play</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>One of the most annoying 
	things a paramotor can do is to stall just when you have the wing safely 
	overhead and are ready to go.&nbsp; You give the paramotor throttle and it 
	promptly dies.&nbsp; What happened?&nbsp; You checked the
	<a href="../../troubleshooting/elecltroubleshooting.htm">ignition system</a>,
	<a href="../../fuelsystemtest.htm">fuel system</a>, and maybe even the reed valve.&nbsp; You have rebuilt the 
	carburetor and are using fresh fuel.&nbsp; The <a href="../popoff/pop-off-pressure.htm">pop-off rest pressure</a> is good.&nbsp; When the motor was new it ran 
	fine.&nbsp; What is wrong?<br><br>The cause might be excessive throttle shaft play.&nbsp; 
	A sign is the presence of copious amounts of 2-cycle oil on or about the 
	center of the carburetor.&nbsp; The oil will not be black but have the same color is had 
	before it was mixed with fuel.&nbsp; It is normal to have some oil on the 
	carburetor but it should not be forming a lot of drips.&nbsp; However, if the 
	connection to the airbox is not tight, you may see a lot of oil at the joint 
	and even some drips.<br><br>Why is this?&nbsp; All 2 cycle engines "spit" 
	some fuel out of the carburetor.&nbsp; As the reed valve closes after the 
	intake stroke, the air fuel mixture that is in the carburetor throat will 
	"bounce back" out of the carburetor.&nbsp; If the joint between the airbox 
	and the carburetor, the fuel leakage will be minimal.<br><br>After a few hundred 
	hours, the constant rotation of the throttle shaft begins to cause serious 
	wear of the soft metal that makes up the bearing surfaces in the carburetor 
	body.&nbsp; On a WG-8 with 250 hours, I measured over .010" (0.25mm) of play 
	in the throttle shaft.&nbsp; Such wear and the air leak can cause changes 
	in the air/fuel mixture at the low and medium ends of the power band by 
	causing a lean-out condition.&nbsp; The most annoying effect can be stalling 
	under a sudden throttle increase from idle.</p>

	<p>This is not a problem that you 
	can easily fix.<br><br>An expert machine shop could bore out and then fit 
	bronze bushings in the old body but the expense would be more than a new 
	carburetor&nbsp; The 
	throttle shaft has to be perfectly aligned for the throttle plate to work 
	correctly, especially at near closed positions.<br><br>Your average home 
	mechanic could probably do a repair using new bushings and epoxy.&nbsp; He 
	would first have to drill oversized holes in the carburetor body with a 
	drill press.&nbsp; The replacement bushings would be about 1 mm smaller than 
	the new holes in the carburetor body.&nbsp; Next, the carburetor would be 
	completely re-assembled with the throttle plate fully closed.&nbsp; Using 
	(30) min epoxy, inject it with a needle around each of the new bushings.&nbsp; 
	This would ensure that the bushings are perfectly aligned.&nbsp; It would 
	take some skill to keep the epoxy out of the tiny holes in the throat of the 
	carburetor.&nbsp; The question would be:&nbsp; would the epoxy hold up to 
	the severe vibrations generated by the Top 80 engine?&nbsp; It would be fun 
	to try this when time permits.<br><br>Purchasing a new carburetor is the 
	easiest thing to do.</p>
	<h2>Minimizing throttle 
	shaft bore wear</h2>
	<p>I have developed a <a href="../../throttlespring/throttlespring.htm">quick 
	and inexpensive modification</a> for the throttle cable return spring system 
	that puts almost no lateral load on the throttle shaft.&nbsp;  
	In this setup, the carburetor only needs the weakest spring to close the 
	throttle plate.&nbsp; The less lateral pressure there is on the shaft due to 
	return springs pushing them to one side, the better, as it will minimize 
	wearing of the bore.</p>
	<p>It is unfortunate that parts other than those of 
	the main engine wear out sooner on the Top 80.&nbsp; Peripheral parts should 
	be designed to wear out at about the same time as the piston or crankshaft 
	bearings.&nbsp; This should include engine and redrive seals which should 
	never go bad like the seals in the old Volvos that were made in Sweden.&nbsp; 
	Those seals would last 30+ years.</p>
