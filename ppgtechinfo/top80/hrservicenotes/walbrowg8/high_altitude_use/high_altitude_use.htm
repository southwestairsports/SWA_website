	<h1>High Altitude (HA) use of the Top 80 &amp; others</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Running a paramotor above 4,000' MSL will cause your midrange and high end performance to suffer.&nbsp; Typical of HA use with the stock jet is roughness, stuttering, excessive vibration, and 
	lower engine output.&nbsp; The higher you fly, the richer the mixture 
	and the worse are the problems.&nbsp; There also will be increased carbon deposits on the surfaces in the combustion chamber and a decrease in fuel economy.</p>
	<p>Putting an EFI system on a paramotor would solve the HA problem but such a system has other problems.&nbsp; Particularly, it greatly complicates the fuel delivery and electrical 
	systems.&nbsp; Also, two-cycle oil in the exhaust stream can foul the primary device used to adjust the fuel mixture: the O2 sensor.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>The best way to fix this problem is to lean out the fuel mixture when flying at high altitudes.&nbsp; Most aviation carburetors have an adjustable main or high speed (HS) jet.&nbsp; The 
	Walbro WG-8, on the other hand, has a fixed main jet.&nbsp; Apparently, long ago too many pilots were burning up their engines by improper adjustment of the high speed needle jet so manufacturers had a fixed main 
	jet installed in the carburetor.&nbsp; In the world of 2-cycle engines, this is unique.</p>
	<p>There are two ways to decrease the main jet size in the WG-8.&nbsp; One way is to modify it and the other is to install a smaller jet.&nbsp; We stock the HA jet for various engines that use the WG-8.&nbsp; <a href="../../../../../ContactUs/contactus.htm">Contact us</a> 
	to purchase.&nbsp; Note that the jets we supply can be new or used -- they function identically.&nbsp; Walbro HA jets are difficult to obtain and have to be specially ordered so we conserve our 
	supply of jets.</p>
	<h2>How to prepare for HA use</h2>
	<p>1. Learn the <a href="../WG8_explode.gif">parts</a> 
	of the carburetor, if needed.&nbsp; You can always refer to this diagram later.&nbsp; If you have any doubts about the condition of the carburetor, rebuild it before making any modifications.&nbsp; Your fuel system must be in TOP working order.&nbsp; Also, 
	it is essential to <a href="../../CHT/cht.htm">install a CHT and tachometer</a> on your Top 80.&nbsp; It might save burning up the engine if you make a mistake somewhere....</p>
	<p>2. Watch the Walbro <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDaOcNrS6BM&amp;feature=youtu.be">carburetor service video</a> if you have not already.</p>
	<p>3. Remove the metering diaphragm cover (#6) and the metering diaphragm.</p>
	<p>4. Using the correct screwdriver (it must fit snugly in the slot on the jet), unscrew the main jet (#16) from the carburetor body.</p>
	<p>5. Either <a href="../carbmodification/jetmod.htm">modify</a> the jet or replace it. The Top 80 HA jet is a #112.&nbsp; The Thor 130 HA jet is a #125.&nbsp; We can also custom make any sized jet, 
	as needed.&nbsp; Contact us to order.</p>
	<p>6. Reassemble the carburetor.&nbsp; Mark the surface of the metering lever diaphragm with the jet size so you will know what's in there.&nbsp; Use a felt-tip pen.</p>

	<p>7. Optional: To further improve the low and midrange performance, pilots can <a href="../midrange_performance/midrange_performance_problems.htm">modify the throttle valve plate</a> (#9).&nbsp; We have the throttle valve plates for the WG-8. <a href="../../../../../ContactUs/contactus.htm">Contact us</a> 
	to order.</p>
	<p>8. Finally, pilots must <a href="../low_speed_adjustment.htm">adjust the low speed</a> part of the system at the altitude where they intend to fly.</p>
	<p>9. Test fly the engine, watching the cylinder head temperature carefully.&nbsp; Engines that have had the HA jet installed should run 10&ordm;C to 20&ordm;C hotter and have significantly higher 
	power output.&nbsp; If it starts to run over specs, shut it down immediately and determine what is wrong.</p>
