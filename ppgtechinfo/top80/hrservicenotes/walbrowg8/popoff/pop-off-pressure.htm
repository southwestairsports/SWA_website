	<h1>Pop-off Pressure</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>The pop-off pressure affects the fuel/air mixture across the entire throttle range and is why it must be set correctly.&nbsp; Do not waste time rebuilding the carburetor without also checking the 
	pop-pressure.&nbsp; Pilots might get lucky with just a rebuild but if there are problems, the gauge must be used.</p>
	<p>1. Obtain a gauge -- A genuine Walbro gauge costs around $190.&nbsp; The
	<a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Mikuni-MK-BN-PMP-Pop-Off-Pump-Gauge-30PSI-Pop-Off-Pressure-Guage-MK-BN-PMP-/331140202365?hash=item4d197e7f7d:g:2IQAAOSwNNxWFKI0&amp;vxp=mtr">Mikuni MK-BN PMP</a> pop-off gauge costs 
	around $60 (2015) and works exactly the same.&nbsp; The stock connecting tube on the Mikuni is too big for the Walbro WG-8 so pilots will have to purchase a
	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reducer-Coupler-4x1-Hose-ID/dp/B000R8NPBQ/ref=sr_1_13?s=industrial&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1451491339&amp;sr=1-13&amp;keywords=1%2F4+barb+1%2F8">1/4" ID x 1/8" ID barb 
	reducing coupler</a> and a short length of 1/8" ID windshield washer hose.&nbsp; Both are available in most auto parts stores.&nbsp; The link for the nylon coupler is for quantity (10) but the 
	cost is under $4 with free shipping.&nbsp; A
	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reducer-Splicer-Fitting-Adapter-Coupler/dp/B00CIX39FU/ref=sr_1_5?s=industrial&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1451491339&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=1%2F4+barb+1%2F8">brass adapter</a> 
	costs about $10 with free shipping.&nbsp; The Walbro knockoff gauges do not have the correct pressure range 
	but can still be used by extrapolation of the scale on the gauge.</p>
	<p>2. Learn how to test the pop-off pressure by watching the Walbro
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDaOcNrS6BM&amp;feature=youtu.be">carburetor service video</a>.</p>
	<p>3. Determine if the inlet valve seat is worn out/damaged.&nbsp; If it is, the carburetor must be replaced.&nbsp; To perform this test, the carburetor must be removed.&nbsp; a.) Replace the inlet needle valve with a new one (from a kit) but 
	do not install the metering lever diaphragm and cover.&nbsp; 
	b.) Put some WD-40 in the inlet needle valve hole and the surrounding area around the metering lever.&nbsp; c.) Pressurize the fuel system with the pop-off gauge to 0.14-0.34 bar (2-5 psi).&nbsp; If there are 
	any bubbles around the needle valve, the valve seat is bad.</p>
	<p>The rest pressure may not hold due to a corroded valve seat e.g. from old fuel, water contamination, and/or ethanol fuels contaminated with water.&nbsp; The technically gifted can try this: 
	Use a modified Q-Tip shaped like a pencil tip, some rubbing compound, and some elbow-grease to cleanup the inlet valve seat.&nbsp; This would work only for light corrosion.</p>
	<p>In any case, if the valve still leaks, the carburetor 
	must&nbsp;be replaced.</p>
	<p>4. Measure the pop-off and rest pressures.&nbsp; The Walbro video does not mention it but it is necessary to wet the inlet needle valve and seat with some WD-40 in order to get a more accurate 
	pressure reading.&nbsp; It is also safer to use this than some fuel/oil mix.&nbsp; The correct pop-off pressure for the Walbro WG-8 is 1.2-1.3 Bar (17.5-19.0 psi).&nbsp; The rest pressure must be more than 
	0.68 Bar (10 psi.)&nbsp; If the pop-off rest pressure is less than the fuel pump pressure 
	of 0.34-0.48 (5-7 psi), the valve will leak and richen the mixture over the entire throttle range.&nbsp; This will cause the engine to idle poorly, if at all.&nbsp; As <a href="../GerryFarellmods.pdf">Gerry Farell notes</a>, 
	the rest pressure is more important than the pop-off pressure.</p>
	<p>5. Analyze the results -- The pop-off fuel pressure is determined by the strength of the metering lever spring.&nbsp; The spring forces the inlet needle valve closed except when acted upon by the metering lever diaphragm which, in turn, is activated by the amount of air flowing through the carburetor.&nbsp; 
	For detailed discussion of this, consult the <a href="../WalbroSM.pdf">Walbro service manual</a>.&nbsp; 
	As parts age, the pop-off pressure drops, including the rest pressure.</p>

	<p>If the pressure is too high, the engine will run lean and may overheat.&nbsp; If too low, it will run rich and full throttle power output will suffer and the engine will run roughly.</p>
	<p>If the valve leaks, the idle will be difficult to adjust and/or the engine will stall.&nbsp; The engine may also run roughly off idle due to a richening of the air/fuel mixture.&nbsp; A badly 
	leaking inlet needle valve will make the engine difficult to start, if at all.</p>
	<p>A weaker spring will cause a low pop-off pressure.&nbsp; A stronger spring increases the pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the pop-off pressure is too high (a rare event), the spring is probably out of specification and should be replaced with the stock spring.&nbsp; Before replacing the spring, rebuild the carburetor, and check the pop-off pressure again.&nbsp; 
	Generally, it is good to replace the spring every time you rebuild the carburetor.&nbsp; The springs are inexpensive.</p>
	<p>Over time, the pop-spring can become brittle or weaken and affect the fuel pressure, usually lowering it (and richening the fuel/air mixture).&nbsp; This is why the pressure must be checked every time the carburetor is rebuilt or when there are complaints about engine performance.&nbsp; Pilots can increase the pressure by adding special brass shims under the spring 
	(available from Southwest Airsports) but this is not necessary in most situations and is not recommended for increasing the pressure due to a weak spring.&nbsp; 
	In the photo below, the spring on the left (marked red) was unable to maintain the correct pressure and caused a rich running condition.&nbsp; The spring on the right is new.&nbsp; Note the difference in length.</p>
	<p><img alt="the pop-off spring on the left is old and brittle" height="212" src="DSCN3925_01.JPG" width="202"></p>
	<p>The combined functions of the main jet AND the pop-off spring determine the air/fuel ratio delivered to the engine at around 3/4 throttle and above.&nbsp; Only the pop-off spring pressure is 
	adjustable.&nbsp; We now have the high altitude jets, if needed.&nbsp; <a href="../../../../../ContactUs/contactus.htm">Contact us</a> to purchase.</p>
	<p>Do NOT stretch or cut the pop-off spring as this will negatively affect the spring at high engine speeds when it is being vigorously exercised.</p>
	<p>Pilots who fly at high altitudes (1,200m MSL/4,000' MSL and above) can adjust the pop-off pressure by adding shims to the existing spring or replacing the spring with one of greater compression strength.&nbsp; We can supply these special shims 
	and springs in different sizes.&nbsp; <a href="../../../../../ContactUs/contactus.htm">Contact us</a> for details.</p>
	<p>DO NOT CONSIDER ADJUSTING THE POP-OFF PRESSURE UNLESS A CYLINDER HEAT TEMPERATURE GAUGE (CHT) IS INSTALLED.</p>
