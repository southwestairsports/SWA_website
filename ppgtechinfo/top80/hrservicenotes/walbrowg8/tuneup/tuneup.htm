	<h1>Rebuilding and tune up of the Walbro WG-8 carburetor</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>Note: the Miniplane blogs have a mix of fact and fiction and are not reliable sources of information.&nbsp; If you want expert advice (that cannot be found on this site), check with a dirt-bike shop 
	or the go-kart guys.&nbsp; They are experts on high performance two cycle engines, like the Top80.</p>
	<p>Remember that a cooler running engine will last longer.&nbsp; Heat kills small engines.&nbsp; Keep this in mind when tuning the Top 80.&nbsp; Install a <a href="../../CHT/cht.htm">cylinder head temperature gauge</a>.</p>
	<p>Note: If the clutch engages at idle (&lt; 2,500 RPM), it is difficult or impossible to adjust the idle properly.&nbsp; <a href="../../clutch/clutch.htm">Fix this first</a>.</p>
	<p>Two things wear out on this carburetor after 300 hours or so: the throttle shaft bushings and the inlet needle valve seat.&nbsp; These are not repairable nor replaceable and the carburetor must 
	be replaced.&nbsp; You will have not idea if the inlet needle valve seat is bad unless you have a pop-off gauge.</p>
	<h2>Preliminaries</h2>
	<p>1.&nbsp;Learn the <a href="../WG8_explode.gif">parts</a> 
	of the carburetor, if needed.&nbsp; It is helpful (!) if you understand how a diaphragm carburetor works.&nbsp; ZAMA's t<a href="../zama/techguide-2007.pdf">echnical guide</a> is the best there is 
	because it is short, simple, and concise.&nbsp; The only difference is that most Walbro's do not have a priming system.</p>
	<p>2.&nbsp;Ignition system check -- Before attempting a carburetor tune-up or rebuild, pilots must first
	<a href="../../troubleshooting/elecltroubleshooting.htm">check the ignition system</a> 
	to see if there are any issues.&nbsp; If your spark plug secondary wire is "open", you are wasting your time tuning up the carburetor.</p>
	<p>3.&nbsp;Pop-off pressure -- It could be a waste of time to rebuild a carburetor if the <a href="../popoff/pop-off-pressure.htm">pop-off pressure</a> is not checked first to verify that the 
	inlet needle valve seat is in good condition.&nbsp; If you do not check this and your carburetor has a few hundred hours on it, you might be lucky and the rebuild will work.</p>
	<p>4.&nbsp;Coil gap -- If the coil has not ever been replaced, this step may be skipped.&nbsp; The coil gap is frequently done incorrectly by amateurs, lawnmower shops, 
	and most mechanics.&nbsp; <a href="../../ignition-coil/ignition-coil.htm">This page</a> gives the 
	instructions on how to check/replace the coil.&nbsp; If a professional 
	replaces the coil, be certain to print out our page on the coil and give it 
	to him.&nbsp; He will need the information.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; the timing 
	should always be <a href="../../timing/check_timing.htm">checked</a> if the 
	coil is replaced.</p>
	<p>5. Reed valve block leaks -- If you think you are having fuel delivery problems, be sure that the reed valve block screws have been properly torqued down.&nbsp; If the block is 
	even slightly loose, the fuel pump will not function properly, if at all.&nbsp; QC with the Italians is some mysterious term that they have yet to figure out so pilots can expect problems on brand 
	new motors.</p>
	<h2>Rebuilding</h2>
	<p>WARNING: Do NOT lose or damage the main jet (#16)!&nbsp; This jet is a custom supplied jet with the Miniplane supplied Walbro WG-8 and is not available anywhere in North America.&nbsp; Some 
	parts distributors have this jet but it is not the correct size for the Top 80.&nbsp; If you do lose or damage it, we can custom make a new one.&nbsp; Contact us.</p>
	<p>1.&nbsp;Purchase a WG-8 rebuild kit, a fuel filter, and a metering lever spring.&nbsp; Check the pickup tube filter to be sure it is not clogged with gel/goo (due to ethanol fuels).&nbsp; Replace it if in doubt.&nbsp; 
	If you can easily blow air through it, it is OK.&nbsp; 
	These parts are available from <a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/parts/carb.htm">Miniplane-USA</a>.</p>
	<p>2.&nbsp;Watch the Walbro <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDaOcNrS6BM&amp;feature=youtu.be">carburetor service video</a>.</p>
	<p>3.&nbsp;If it has been more than a year 
	or if ethanol fuels have been used, replace the <a href="../../fuelfilters/fuel_filter.htm">fuel filter</a>.&nbsp; Do NOT purchase a fuel filter from an auto parts store because they are almost 
	always of inferior quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always replace the metering lever spring when rebuilding the carburetor.&nbsp; The life of the spring is dependent on what kind of fuel is used and 
	what climate you live and fly in.&nbsp; It is so inexpensive to replace the spring and be assured that your pop-off pressure is correct.&nbsp; A weak spring enriches the air/fuel mixture and 
	engine performance will suffer dramatically, especially midrange.</p>
	<p>Note: the rebuilt kit will have many extra parts in it.&nbsp; Hang on to 
	them in case they might be needed in the future, e.g. if a Welch plug needs to 
	be replaced.</p>
	<p>4.&nbsp;Clean the outside of the carburetor with brake cleaner and remove the carburetor from the engine.</p>
	<p>5.&nbsp;Remove both cover plates, all diaphragms, and gaskets.</p>
	<p>6.&nbsp;Remove the metering lever assembly.</p>
	<p>7.&nbsp;If the fuel inlet screen (#45) on the pump side of the carburetor has the tiniest bit of debris in it, remove the screen with a fine pick-tool or needle.&nbsp; The presence of debris in it means that 
	the pilot is not using the correct fuel filter.&nbsp; Sintered bronze filters DO NOT filter 
	the fine debris which will clog the fuel inlet screen.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>8.&nbsp;Examine the carburetor -- With a magnifying headset or glass, 
	carefully examine every part, including the carburetor body.&nbsp; If there 
	is any gunk or water drops anywhere, it is a symptom of using 
	gasoline with ethanol, water in the fuel system, and/or old fuel (more than two weeks old).</p>
	<p>9. Clean the carburetor -- If 
	the carburetor had any gunk or water in it, also remove the idle needle (#39).&nbsp; Carefully spray the entire carburetor and parts with carburetor cleaner (available at auto parts stores).&nbsp; Blow with compressed air.&nbsp; Be certain that all passageways are clear.&nbsp; It is rare that the Welch plugs on the 
	carburetor will have to be removed.&nbsp; Take a Q-Tip, cut the cotton ball off of one end, and make a fine point.&nbsp; Take the pointed end, push it down into the inlet needle valve hole, and 
	firmly twist the Q-Tip back and forth.&nbsp; This will clean the valve seat of light corrosion, if there is any.&nbsp; Now, soak the other end of the Q-Tip with carburetor cleaner and clean the 
	valve once more.&nbsp; This will remove any fuel gum and residues, as the Walbro service manual notes.&nbsp; Pilots might want to consider the regular addition of Techron fuel additive to their 
	fuel mix.&nbsp; This stuff cleans the guts of carburetors and fuel system like nothing else.&nbsp; The downside is that it is a bit hard on fuel tubing.</p>
	<p>Main nozzle check valve -- It is rare to have a problem with the main nozzle check valve (#15).&nbsp; If it is defective or gummed up, the engine will not idle at all because air will flow from 
	the main nozzle into the metering chamber, effectively stopping fuel from entering the idle circuit.&nbsp; The ONLY way to check this is take a piece of fuel tubing about a foot long and place one 
	end of it tightly over the main jet (#16) and then try to suck on the other end of the tubing.&nbsp; You should be able to blow easily but not suck.&nbsp; The tough part is to be certain the 
	tubing is tightly covering the main jet so that it does not leak.&nbsp; A dab of Vaseline placed around the edges of the main jet can help seal things.&nbsp; If the check valve leaks, remove the 
	Welch plug (#18) and see why the valve is not functioning.&nbsp; You will need a Welch plug service tool to do this (available from Walbro distributors or from us).&nbsp; Thankfully, a replacement 
	plug is included in the Walbro service kits, if you need it.&nbsp; Hopefully, the valve is only gunked up and is fixable.&nbsp; However, if anything else is wrong, the carburetor be replaced as 
	this part is not available.</p>
	<p>10.&nbsp; Install the idle needle (part #39) to 1 1/4 turns out from all 
	the way screwed in.&nbsp; Be very careful not to force the needle against the 
	seat or it will ruin the carburetor.&nbsp; Those who live at high altitude should set the idle needle to 1 1/8 turns.</p>
	<p>11.&nbsp; Install the new fuel inlet screen if it was removed.&nbsp; Using the eraser end of an ordinary pencil, gently 
	push the screen in just below the inlet hole which is on the side of the passage.&nbsp; If you do not do this correctly, the high speed system will not work right.</p>
	<p id="Install_the_new_metering_lever">12.&nbsp; Install the new inlet needle valve and 
	related parts.&nbsp; At this point, the metering lever height must be 
	checked and adjusted.&nbsp; The Top 80 service manual specifies a distance of 0.5mm – 
	0.7mm (from the top of the metering lever to the top edge of the carburetor 
	body).&nbsp; The preformed height of new ML's is different than specifications and must be changed to the correct value.&nbsp; For the curious, this problem is discussed in <a href="../ml_height-variations.htm">this article</a>.</p>
	<p>If a depth gauge and a caliper to precisely measure it are not available, the old ML can be used as it is 0.7mm thick.&nbsp; Bend the OLD metering lever to 90 degrees.&nbsp; In the depression 
	where the new ML sits, put the bent part of the old ML right next to the forked end of the new ML.&nbsp; They should be the same height.&nbsp; The ML adjustment is not critical as it does not 
	effect the pop-off pressure -- which is critical!</p>
	<p>If necessary, remove the ML and gently bend the side going to the valve.&nbsp; Use a pair of needle nose pliers to hold the short side of the ML while you bend the long side.&nbsp; Be extremely 
	careful doing this as you must not deform the pivot hole through the ML.&nbsp; If 
	the distance is too great, the carburetor will lean out at high loads.&nbsp; 
	If it is too little, the valve will leak and idle will be impossible 
	to adjust.</p>
	<p>Note: the Walbro depth gauge should not be used because it does not give the correct 
	value for the custom WG-8 used in the Top 80.</p>
	<p><span class="italics">Do not install the new gasket, diaphragm, and cover on the metering lever side of the carburetor -- these will be installed after the pop-off pressure is checked.</span></p>
	<p>13.&nbsp;Install the fuel pump diaphragm, gasket, and cover plate.&nbsp; 
	Be CERTAIN that the diaphragm goes on first and then the gasket.&nbsp; Most 
	kits contain an ethanol resistant fuel pump diaphragm.&nbsp; If ethanol 
	blends are used, this special diaphragm (clear in color) should be used.&nbsp; 
	The downside of this gasket is that it is not as supple as the rubber diaphragm and will 
	not pump quite as well, but this should not be an issue.</p>
	<p>14.&nbsp;Check the
	<a href="../popoff/pop-off-pressure.htm">pop-off pressure</a>.&nbsp; If the rest pressure will not hold, the valve seat is damaged/worn out and <span class="bold">the carburetor must be replaced </span>
	(but you should have checked this earlier)!&nbsp; 
	If the rest pressure is below specification but holds, it means that the pop-off spring is bad and must be replaced.&nbsp; However, it should be replaced every time the carburetor is rebuilt, 
	anyway.&nbsp; 
	Low pop-off pressure should rarely be a problem unless the inlet valve seat is bad or the spring is bad.</p>
	<p>15.&nbsp;Install the carburetor on the engine, replace the fuel 
	filter, but do not connect the fuel line to the carburetor.</p>
	<p>16.&nbsp;Place a small amount of fuel in the tank and pressurize the 
	tank.&nbsp; Fuel should dribble freely out of the line that connects to the 
	carburetor.&nbsp; This is an important step that ensures that the fuel 
	system up to the carburetor is working properly.&nbsp; If ethanol fuels have 
	been used, it is common for the filter on the end of the pick up tube in the 
	tank to become clogged with gel/goo.&nbsp; If this is the case, it must be 
	replaced.&nbsp; But you are using AVGAS, hopefully, so this will not be a problem.</p>
	<p>17.&nbsp;Connect the fuel line and pressurize the tank.&nbsp; No fuel should leak out of the carburetor, including past the inlet needle valve.</p>
	<p>18.&nbsp;Now, install the new ML gasket, diaphragm, and plate cover.&nbsp; Be 
	CERTAIN that the gasket goes on first and then the diaphragm (this is opposite of how the fuel pump diaphragm is installed).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Install the air box.</p>
	<p>19.&nbsp;Prime the carburetor and start the engine using
	<a href="../../Starting/starting.htm">this method</a>.&nbsp; If done properly, the 
	choke will never be needed except to stop the engine in case of a kill 
	switch failure or to start the engine in the air after a long period.&nbsp; If the carburetor does not have a priming lever, use 
	the end of Q-Tip that has had the cotton cut off or a tooth pick.&nbsp; It 
	is advisable to purchase a priming lever (primer spring) if it is 
	missing.&nbsp; These are available from
	<a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/parts/carb.htm">Miniplane-USA</a>.&nbsp; Note that this technique for easily starting the engine will not work on engines where the pilot cannot easily position the 
	inlet side of the carburetor lower than the outlet side.</p>
	<p>20.&nbsp;After the engine has warmed up to operating temperature, <a href="../low_speed_adjustment.htm">adjust the carburetor</a>.&nbsp; Remember that changes in altitude, temperature, and humidity will affect the low speed adjustments on the carburetor.</p>
	<p>21.&nbsp;Test fly the engine.&nbsp; Properly tuned engines should be able to run at full throttle for at least 5 minutes.&nbsp; Fade or lack of 
	power output is probably due to ignition system problems, such as a broken 
	secondary wire or a worn out or incorrectly gapped spark plug.</p>
	<p>Engine output will drop about 100 RPM for every 1,000' of altitude above 
	sea level.&nbsp; Propeller condition and type will also influence power output 
	dramatically.</p>
