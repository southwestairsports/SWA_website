	<h1>Carburetor Failure</h1>
	<p>As carburetors are used, they will eventually fail to deliver the proper 
	air-fuel mixture to the engine.&nbsp; When this happens, the engine will run 
	roughly or fail to run at all.&nbsp; The symptoms can be noticed at idle, in 
	the mid-range, or at full throttle.&nbsp; A failed carburetor can burn up an engine if it is not fixed immediately.</p>
	<p>It is assumed that the pilot has always used fresh, clean, high octane 
	fuel and high quality 2 cycle oil.&nbsp; Note that use of ethanol fuels 
	will greatly increase carburetor problems because of the tendency of 
	ethanol/gasoline mixes to attract water and to dissolve everything it comes 
	in contact with, especially plastics and rubber.&nbsp; Ethanol also conducts 
	electricity.&nbsp; This causes electrolysis of metal parts and is why pilots 
	should never leave gasoline/ethanol mixes in the fuel system for long, 
	especially in hot weather. &nbsp; Please read our <a href="../fueloilspecs/fuelOil.htm">
	fuel section</a> to learn about the correct fuels, oils, and how to prevent 
	problems caused by ethanol.</p>
	<p>DO NOT STORE FUEL MIXED WITH OIL FOR MORE THAN A FEW WEEKS!&nbsp; Old gasoline and old fuel/oil mixes cause gum, varnish, and sludge buildup in carburetors.&nbsp; If the fuel contains ethanol, 
	these problems will be much more common.&nbsp; Avoid ethanol blends if at all possible.</p>
	<h2>Fuel inlet needle</h2>
	<p>The most common point of failure in diaphragm type carburetors is 
	the deformation/erosion of the tip of the fuel inlet needle.&nbsp; When this 
	happens, the pop-off pressure will be lower and the engine will run richer 
	(and rougher).&nbsp; Engine idle is also badly affected because of fuel 
	leakage into the carburetor.&nbsp; Leakage of the inlet needle can be 
	noticed when attempting to adjust the carburetor's low speed system:&nbsp;the low speed needle can be completely screwed in (closed) with little or no 
	effect.</p>
	<p>If you have a pop-off gauge, you can check for this problem in less than a minute without disassembling the carburetor.</p>
	<p>The inlet needle will eventually wear out/fail no matter what kind of 
	fuel is used.&nbsp; The needle goes up and down 150 times per second and is the first part of the carburetor to wear out.</p>
	<p>Most pilots should rebuild their carburetors every year, at the least.&nbsp; 
	Pilots who fly extensively will notice problems with engine performance 
	after about 50 hours.&nbsp; Routine carburetor maintenance and spark plug 
	replacement are quick and easy fixes to the most common types of engine 
	performance issues. </p>
	<h2>Diaphragms</h2>
	<p>The second most common problem is the hardening and deterioration of the 
	diaphragms inside the carburetor.&nbsp; Because of the presence of ethanol 
	in gasoline, this problem has become acute in recent years.&nbsp; When the 
	fuel metering and/or fuel pump diaphragm become stiff, the engine will 
	tend to run lean because the fuel pump cannot keep up with the demand for 
	fuel.&nbsp; The valves in the pump will also fail to close properly further 
	decreasing the pump's capacity.&nbsp; Sometimes, the fuel pump diaphragm 
	will become so stiff that the engine will not run at all.&nbsp; Pilots who 
	never purge their fuel systems before storage will have many more problems 
	with the carburetor, especially if they use gasoline that contains ethanol.</p>
	<h2>Metering lever spring</h2>
	<p>This spring is critical for keeping the fuel/air ratio correct and weakens with age whether the engine is run or not.&nbsp; Ethanol fuels can also corrode it because of the presence of water 
	dissolved in the ethanol.&nbsp; This is an acute problem in humid environments.&nbsp; The <a href="popoff/pop-off-pressure.htm">pop-off pressure</a> must be regularly checked.&nbsp; If the rest pressure is below specification, the engine will run rich throughout the throttle range.</p>
	<p>Rebuilding the carburetor is 
	the simplest way to solve most problems.&nbsp; Be sure to get the 
	complete kit as it contains the inlet needle valve which is the most common 
	part to fail.&nbsp; At the same time, be sure to replace the metering lever spring.&nbsp; This part has to be purchased separately from the rebuilt kit.&nbsp;&nbsp; When rebuilding the carburetor, always check/change the 
	spark plug.&nbsp; These items are available from
