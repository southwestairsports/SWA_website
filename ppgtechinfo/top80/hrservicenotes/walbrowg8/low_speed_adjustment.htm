	<h1>Adjusting the idle and low speed system on the WG-8</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>If your carburetor is the WB-37, <a href="../../../wb37/wb37.htm">follow this link</a> to adjust the idle and low speed system.</p>
	<p>For clutched motors: If the clutch engages at idle (&lt; 2,200 RPM), it is impossible to adjust the idle properly. <a href="../clutch/clutch.htm">Fix this first</a>.</p>
	<p>If your engine will not idle no matter how you adjust it, you may have a rare issue with the main nozzle check valve.&nbsp; If you think this might be your problem, see #9 of the rebuilding 
	section of <a href="tuneup/tuneup.htm">Rebuilding and tune up of the Walbro WG-8 carburetor</a>.</p>
	<p>Note that the idle and low speed system 
	must be re-adjusted whenever there is a significant change (&gt; 1,000') in the operating altitude or ambient temperature.&nbsp; Here are part numbers for the <a href="WG8_explode.gif">WG-8</a> (referenced below) 
	and the <a href="../../../wb37/wb37.htm">WB-37</a>.</p>
	<p>1.&nbsp;If it has been removed or tampered with, set the idle needle (part #39, the one without the cone on it) to 1 1/4 turns out from all the way screwed 
	in.&nbsp; Be careful not to force the needle against the seat or you 
	will damage the carburetor.&nbsp; Warm up the engine, if necessary, for a 
	few minutes.&nbsp; If the carburetor is far out of adjustment, screw in the idle speed screw (part #27 with the cone on it) so that the engine will idle without stalling.&nbsp; It does not matter 
	at this point if the engine idles too fast or too slow.</p>
	<p>2. Screw the idle needle (part #39) in or out by 1/8 turn increments 
	until the engine runs the maximum speed.&nbsp; This needle adjusts the amount of air + fuel MIXTURE entering the engine.&nbsp; Wait (10) seconds between each change of the idle needle because it takes time for the adjustment to take effect.&nbsp; 
	You can play with this adjustment, screwing the needle too far in (engine slows from a lean mixture) or screwing the needle to far out (engine slows from a rich mixture) to see how the idle needle 
	works.&nbsp; When the the idle needle is at the right position (correct fuel-air mixture) for your altitude, the engine will run the fastest at a PARTICULAR throttle valve setting.&nbsp; This must 
	be set correctly before adjusting the idle SPEED in the next step.</p>
	<p>3.&nbsp;Set the idle speed screw 
	(part #27 with the cone on it) just fast enough so that the clutch does not engage, causing the propeller to rotate.&nbsp; If your engine does not have a clutch, set the idle speed to specs or 
	about 2,200 RPM.&nbsp; If your carburetor was way out of adjustment, you may have to unscrew it 
	a turn or two to bring the engine speed down.&nbsp; The engine must not idle so slow as to engage the starter tangs 
	(when they strike the starter pawl, they make a 
	ratcheting sound).&nbsp; This 
	speed is around 2,200 RPM.&nbsp; As with the idle needle adjustment, wait (10) seconds between adjustments for the engine speed to stabilize.&nbsp; Stop the engine and restart.&nbsp; The idle 
	should be steady.</p>
	<p>4.&nbsp;Open the idle needle (part #39) an additional 1/8 turn.&nbsp; This will ensure that the low and midrange systems are not running too lean.&nbsp; It is always safer to have the engine 
	run a bit too rich rather than too lean, per Miniplane's recommendation.&nbsp; This will prevent overheating of the engine in the midrange and is particularly important if you run your paramotor 
	at or near sea level.</p>
	<p>Once the idle and low speed systems have been adjusted, the <a href="high_speed_adjustment.htm">high speed system</a> may be adjusted, if necessary.&nbsp; Unless there are problems with the engine running at 3/4 throttle and above, changes 
	there should not be necessary.</p>
	<p>Do not idle the engine excessively, as is often done before launch.&nbsp; This will foul the plug, slow the idle, and cause carbon build up inside the cylinder.</p>
	<p>If carburetor adjustments do not work as expected, there may be other issues.&nbsp; Check the <a href="../fuelsystemtest.htm">fuel delivery system</a> and make sure that it is working properly.&nbsp; The metering lever height 
	may need to be <a href="tuneup/tuneup.htm#Install_the_new_metering_lever">checked and adjusted</a>.&nbsp; If the <a href="../troubleshooting/elecltroubleshooting.htm">ignition system</a> 
	has any defects, starting will be difficult and the top end performance will suffer.&nbsp; If the carburetor is
	<a href="throttleshaftplay/throttleshaftplay.htm">worn out</a>, it will not idle or run smoothly.&nbsp; If the reed valve block is not torqued down properly it will leak and the fuel pump will not 
	work properly, especially at 3/4 throttle and above while in the air (the time of the greatest load on the engine).&nbsp; Always check these things before assuming the carburetor is defective. </p>
