	<h1>Metering lever height variation in the Walbro WG-8</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>Over the years, I have noted 
	that Miniplane ships out new Top 80 engines with the metering lever (ML) height on the carburetor 
	set to a value different than given in their service manual.&nbsp; Extensive 
	tests have demonstrated that Miniplane's Italian service manual value is correct rather than 
	the value measured in carburetors on new engines from the factory.</p>
	<p>Why 
	is this?&nbsp; I am not sure.&nbsp; Dave Jewell of blue Sky PPG suggests 
	that Miniplane may have failed to update the specifications when they 
	changed carburetors some years ago.&nbsp; For a long time, I set ML's to the 
	same value as on new engines.&nbsp; This was a mistake, as I now realize.&nbsp; 
	The problems we experienced were poor throttle response and occasional 
	stalling when suddenly going to full power.&nbsp; In addition, leaning out the high speed mixture can quickly overheat the engine and cause permanent damage.<br><br>The measured value on new 
	WG-8's has consistently been 1.7mm.&nbsp; This is also the same measured 
	value of ML's in the rebuild kits from Walbro.&nbsp; This high value 
	prevents the inlet needle valve from opening fully (only about 0.5mm).&nbsp; At 
	the lower value specified in the Italian Miniplane service manual, the valve 
	will open 1mm.&nbsp; This is a significant difference  â€“  100% greater.<br>
	<br>I tested a newly rebuilt engine with both values.&nbsp; With the high 
	value, sudden operation of the throttle almost always stalled the engine (it 
	was briefly starved of fuel).&nbsp; With the low value, I could hit the 
	throttle to fully open from idle and the engine would immediately accelerate 
	to full speed without sputtering or stalling.&nbsp; It also seemed that the 
	mid range was also smoother.&nbsp; I wondered whether running at full load 
	for extended periods might burn up the engine if the higher value (1.7mm) 
	was used?&nbsp; This is not something I wanted to find out.<br><br>
	Obviously, engines with the higher ML value will run but may fade when going 
	to full power or have poorer throttle response.&nbsp; There is also the risk 
	of leaning out the engine (burning it up).&nbsp;</p>
