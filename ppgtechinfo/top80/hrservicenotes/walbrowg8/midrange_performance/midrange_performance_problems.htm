	<h1>Midrange performance problems on paramotors</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Paramotors that use the Walbro WG-8 will run roughly in the midrange (4.5K-7.5K RPM).&nbsp; It is engine misfire caused by a rich mixture which gets worse at higher altitudes (above 3,500' MSL).&nbsp; This problem is acute with the Polini's.&nbsp; 
	It is an annoyance because at certain throttle setting near cruising speed, the engine may jump from misfiring to complete firing at the same throttle setting.&nbsp; The result is a surge or a 
	fade and the pilot must hopelessly tweak the throttle back and forth.</p>
	<p>The cause of all this is excessive fuel being drawn into the engine via the idle/low speed circuit of the WG-8.&nbsp; We can thank the go-kart guys for a solution to this problem.</p>
	<p>By modifying the throttle plate at the right location, the air/fuel mixture can be leaned out in the midrange.&nbsp; The photo below shows the WG-8 carburetor from the engine side.&nbsp; The arrow points to the notch 
	(adjacent to the part #305) in the plate that controls the amount of air going past the idle progression holes in the carburetor throat.&nbsp; The notch affects the amount of air only at idle and the low midrange.&nbsp; As the throttle plate opens, the main jet begins to take over.&nbsp; Those who would like to read more on actual workings of the Walbro in this way can examine the
	<a href="../WalbroSM.pdf" target="_blank">Walbro 
	service manual</a>.&nbsp; (It is a large file and should be downloaded first and then read.)</p>
	<p><img alt="Walbro WG-8 from the engine side showing the throttle plate" height="480" src="IMG_6296_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>Increasing the size of the notch will allow more air through the carburetor while lessening the venturi effect on the idle progression holes.&nbsp; The net result is more air and less fuel going into the engine at the midrange.</p>
	<p>Replacing or <a href="../carbmodification/jetmod.htm" target="_blank">modifying </a>the main jet with a smaller one should also be done if you are flying at high altitude.&nbsp; We have 
	throttle plates and high 
	altitude (HA) jets, if needed.&nbsp; <a href="../../../../../ContactUs/contactus.htm" target="_blank">Contact us</a> to purchase.&nbsp; </p>
	<h2>Throttle plate modification</h2>
	<p>It is a good idea to have some spare throttle plates on hand (we have them if needed).</p>
	<p><span class="italics">Pilots must not attempt this modification, use an HA jet, or a modified throttle plate unless they have a 
	<a href="../../CHT/cht.htm" target="_blank">cylinder temperature gauge</a> (CHT) installed on the engine.</span></p>
	<p>For those who do not want to modify the throttle plate, we can supply a modified Top 80 throttle plate for use at both low and high altitudes.&nbsp; The cost is $30 with free shipping within 
	the U.S.&nbsp; <a href="../../../../../ContactUs/contactus.htm">Contact us</a> to order.&nbsp; Please tell us at what altitude you will be using your Top 80.</p>
	<p>Note: All modifications to your paramotor are done at your own risk.</p>
	<p>1.&nbsp; Remove the air box.&nbsp; Disconnect the throttle return spring from the throttle lever that is on top of the carburetor.&nbsp; Undo the two carburetor screws.&nbsp; Disconnect the 
	choke from the carburetor and push the wire down through the hole in the choke lever.&nbsp; Pull on the choke know so that the choke wire is out of the way.&nbsp; Now you can slide the carburetor 
	off enough to access the throttle plate without having to disconnect the fuel line or the throttle cable. from the engine.&nbsp; Unscrew the idle speed adjustment (the screw with the cone) 6 complete turns.</p>
	<p>2.&nbsp; Remove the screw that holds the throttle plate to the throttle shaft and place the throttle plate in a vise.&nbsp; Sandwich the plate between two pieces of wood.&nbsp; Do NOT clamp 
	directly on the plate with anything but soft wood or you may bend the plate and ruin it.</p>
	<p><img alt="Walbro WG8 throttle plate" height="480" src="DSCN5513_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>3.&nbsp; Using a round <a href="../../../../toolkit/paramotor_essential_toolkit.htm" target="_blank">needle (rat-tail) file</a> (3.25mm), enlarge the notch adjacent to the idle progression holes (the correct notch is the one closest to the throttle plate 
	model #).&nbsp; It should not take more than 15-20 strokes with the file to get the right depth.&nbsp; Go SLOW and compare the values below with what you are doing.&nbsp; Use a digital caliper to 
	take the measurements.&nbsp; The values here (other than the default) are for engines flying at high altitude.&nbsp; If you are flying at or near sea level, start with a notch that is 20% less 
	than these values.&nbsp; The depth is measured from the shallower side of the notch.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>default notch - 2.0mm wide x 0.7mm deep</li>
		<li>Polini Thor 100 - 4.7mm wide x 1.8mm deep</li>
		<li>Top 80 - 3.8mm wide x 1.5mm deep -- This is the maximum value.&nbsp; It is best to first try 3.4mm x 1.3mm first, especially if you are near sea level.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Be sure to maintain the same cut angle (15&ordm;) as the original notch.&nbsp; Gently use the file to smooth any rough edges on the notch.&nbsp; If the cut is too large, the idle speed will not be able to be controlled.&nbsp; You can use a diamond scribe to note the new dimensions on the 
	modified plate.&nbsp; If you change it to increase the width and depth, just draw a line through the old dimensions and write the new dimensions on another clear spot on the plate.</p>
	<p>4.&nbsp; Replace the plate on the throttle shaft.&nbsp; In addition to the advice below, snap the throttle shut a number of times from 1/4 open to be certain that the throttle plate is centered in the throat 
	of the carburetor before tightening the central screws.&nbsp; The plate will only center fully if the idle speed adjustment screw does not touch the throttle lever.</p>
	<blockquote><span class="italics">When you place the throttle flap back, ensure it closes completely before tightening it to its shaft, and don't push too hard while tightening it or you will bend the delicate brass shaft.&nbsp; Add one small drop of Loctite to its central screw. Mount the carb on the engine and make sure the throttle cable permits the complete throttle assembly to open and return “all the way” against the stop! 
		- Gerry Farell</span></blockquote>
	<p>Screw in the idle speed adjustment screw 5 complete turns.&nbsp; This is just an approximate setting.</p>
	<p>5.&nbsp; Reassemble everything, start the engine, and adjust the l<a href="../low_speed_adjustment.htm">ow speed system</a>.&nbsp; The more the midrange performance improves, the more chance 
	that you will not be able to adjust the idle low enough to keep the propeller from spinning.&nbsp; If you cannot adjust the idle properly (too fast with the cone screw not contacting the throttle 
	lever), get another throttle plate and start over.&nbsp; Before you modify another plate, make sure you note the dimensions of the notch on the current plate.&nbsp; When you do notch another 
	plate, you will know not to go do deep when making the notch.</p>
	<p>6. Test fly the engine.&nbsp; Carefully observe the CHT.&nbsp; Engines can overheat, even during midrange operation.</p>
	<p>Thanks are due to the world of the go-kart guys, Gerry Farell and Scott Travers for their work on this issue.</p>
