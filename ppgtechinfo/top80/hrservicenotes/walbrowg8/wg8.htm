	<h1>Walbro WG-8 carburetor</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson &amp; others</p>
	<h2>Introductory Notes</h2>
	<p>All carburetors should be rebuilt every year if they have had any contact with fuel, especially fuel containing ethanol.&nbsp; The flexible parts of the carburetor begin to age when 
	they contact gasoline and it is much worse if it contains ethanol.&nbsp; Do not waste your 
	time tuning your engine without first rebuilding the carburetor if it has not been done recently.</p>
	<p>Pilots who are not experienced with working on carburetors should  
	watch the official Walbro <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDaOcNrS6BM&amp;feature=youtu.be">carburetor service</a> video.&nbsp; If you want to service your own carburetor properly, you need to invest in a
	<a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Mikuni-MK-BN-PMP-Pop-Off-Pump-Gauge-30PSI-Pop-Off-Pressure-Guage-MK-BN-PMP-/331140202365?hash=item4d197e7f7d:g:2IQAAOSwNNxWFKI0&amp;vxp=mtr">pop-off gauge</a>.&nbsp; 
	It is <span class="bold">impossible</span> to check the function of a diaphragm type carburetor without a pop-off gauge.&nbsp; If you do not have a pop-off gauge, you will have to trust that 
	important parts of the carburetor are OK.&nbsp; Maybe they are work, maybe not -- you will never know unless you have the pop-off gauge.</p>
	<p><span class="bold">ZAMA Info</span>&nbsp; If you want to understand how the 
	Walbro works, the ZAMA carburetor is a Walbro knockoff.&nbsp; ZAMA has this 
	<a href="zama/techguide-2007.pdf">technical guide </a>which is simpler to understand than anything from 
	Walbro.&nbsp; This guide contains instructions on how diaphragm (and other 
	types) carburetors 
	work, a troubleshooting chart, and how to disassemble and service them.&nbsp; 
	They also have published some <a href="zama/zama-service-tips.pdf">service 
	tips</a> which also apply to the WG-8.&nbsp; Note: no ZAMA carburetor will fit the Top 80 which it too bad.</p>
	<p>If you do not want to do the repairs yourself but have a professional do 
	it, we can help.&nbsp; Please <a href="../../../../ContactUs/contactus.htm">

	those who are not familiar with diaphragm type carburetors.&nbsp; It is a good place
