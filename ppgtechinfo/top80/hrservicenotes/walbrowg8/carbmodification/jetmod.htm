	<h1>How to modify fixed jet sizes in small engines</h1>
	<p>By Had Robinson</p>
	<p>An annoying problem with small engine carburetors is adjusting the main 
	jet size for a particular altitude and temperature.&nbsp; Often enough, no 
	one knows where the jets can be obtained or who makes them?&nbsp; With the 
	method below, you can safely modify a jet of any type of carburetor to see 
	which size works the best.&nbsp; Then, if the jets are available, you can 
	buy what you need and nothing more.&nbsp; We can custom make any jet for the Walbro WG<br>&nbsp;<br>An alternative way to adjust the high range is 
	to change the <a href="../popoff/pop-off-pressure.htm">pop-off pressure</a>.&nbsp; In some situations, both the main jet and pop-pressure must be changed.<br>&nbsp;<br>My technique is an inexpensive, easy, and 
	practical method to change the jet size with reasonable precision that will 
	not harm the existing jet.&nbsp; The modification can be 
	reversed in less than a minute with ordinary tools.&nbsp; The only drawback 
	is that you cannot increase the jet size, only decrease it.&nbsp; But this is rarely a problem as 
	main jets are calibrated for sea level.</p>
	<h2>Supplies needed</h2>
	<p>DO NOT ATTEMPT CHANGES TO THE MAIN JET OF ANY CARBURETOR UNLESS THERE IS A CYLINDER TEMPERATURE GAUGE INSTALLED ON THE ENGINE.</p>
	<blockquote>#30 or 
	#27 AWG magnet wire insulated or non-insulated (the paint insulation will 
	eventually be dissolved by the fuel running through it).&nbsp; You can 
	always use what you have on hand.&nbsp; Any copper wire will do as long as 
	you know its size and it is small enough.&nbsp; Electronics supply stores 
	generally have magnet wire in stock.<br>&nbsp;<br>A jewelers loupe or magnifying 
	glasses – you must be able to carefully see what you are doing.</blockquote>
	<p>Here is complete list of the 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge">cross sectional area of various wire sizes</a>. Here 
	are some cross sectional areas of some sample magnet wire in mm2:</p>
	<blockquote>#30 – 0.0509 mm2<br>#27 – 0.102 mm2 – This is the ideal size as its 
	insertion in the jet will reduce the jet size by about 5 with the larger jet 
	sizes (&gt;100).<br>#22 – 0.326 mm2</blockquote>
	<h2>1. Determine the jet size that you 
	will probably need</h2>
	<p>
This can be done using this
	<a href="MainJetCorrectionChart.pdf">
	chart</a>.&nbsp; For example, your existing main jet is a size #170 and you 
	want to run your small engine at 4,500’ MSL 86ºF.&nbsp; According to the 
	table, the conversion factor is 0.94.&nbsp;&nbsp;0.94 x 170 = 159.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
	nearest whole jet size would be a #160.&nbsp; This is the approximate jet 
	size you would need.&nbsp; It is important that you carefully check whether 
	your engine is running too lean after any modification of the jet size.&nbsp; 
	Use a CHT (cylinder head temperature) or an EGT (exhaust gas temperature) 
	gauge.&nbsp; The EGT is the best to use because of its quick response which 
	will help prevent the pilot from leaning down the engine too far and burning 
	it up.&nbsp; However, it is difficult to install.&nbsp; The CHT, on the 
	other hand, is easy to install but it has a slow response and, accordingly, 
	must be used carefully.&nbsp; Be patient and NEVER do any radical changes to 
	the jet size.&nbsp; Only increase the load on the engine SLOWLY so the CHT 
	can catch up.&nbsp; The
	<a href="http://www.trailtech.net/digital-gauges/tto">TTO Temperature 
	Digital Gauge</a> is an inexpensive CHT that will do the job.&nbsp; It is 
	available from <a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/pages/instruments.htm">
	Miniplane USA</a>.&nbsp; Running an engine too lean at full throttle&nbsp;can burn it up quickly!</p>
	<h2>2. Determine how many strands of wire are needed to 
	decrease the jet size</h2>
	<p>
We need to know the cross sectional area (CSA) 
	of the original and the proposed jet sizes as this is what determines how 
	much fuel flows through the jet.&nbsp; (Refer to this <a href="JetSizes.pdf">this chart</a> for the CSA of standard jets.)&nbsp; When we know the difference 
	between the two sizes, we can reduce the jet size by inserting strands of 
	fine wire in the jet.&nbsp; In the example above, we want to reduce the jet 
	size from a #170 (2.27mm2) to #160 (2.01mm2).&nbsp; 2.27mm2 - 2.01mm2 = 
	0.26mm2.&nbsp; #30 wire has a CSA of 0.0511mm2.&nbsp; 0.26mm2/0.051mm2 = 5 
	strands of #30 wire would be needed in the throat of the jet.<br><br>The 
	addition of multiple strands of wire and the method to keep it in place will 
	decrease the effective CSA of the original jet a bit more – about 15%. So, 
	in the above example, try 4 strands of the #30 wire and see how the engine 
	runs.<br><br>Generally, a single strand of #30 magnet wire will reduce the 
	jet size by about 2 and #27 will reduce it by 5.</p>
	<h2>3. Add the wire to the Jet</h2>
	<p>
Carefully remove the main jet from the carburetor using a premium 
	screwdriver that has a perfectly flat blade or use one that has small 
	horizontal ridges up and down the tip, like Sears Craftsman screwdrivers.&nbsp; 
	Do NOT use the poor quality screwdrivers sold at auto supply stores.&nbsp; 
	Make sure the blade completely fills the slot of the jet (that it is exactly 
	the width and length of the slot).&nbsp; This way you will not strip the 
	slot when you remove the jet.&nbsp; Press the blade firmly into the slot and 
	just turn it a little.&nbsp; It should break free easily.&nbsp; If it does 
	not, apply a little WD40 or equivalent.&nbsp; If you have a micro-torch, you 
	can quickly heat the carburetor body for a few seconds.<br><br>Note which 
	side of the jet housing has the most space.&nbsp; Usually, the jet screws 
	into a hollow space that has less clearance than the top of the jet housing.&nbsp; 
	However, with the Walbro, the diaphragm is right above the jet so the 
	greater clearance is below the jet in the housing.<br><br>The arrow in the 
	photo below points to the main jet in a Walbro. (Note that some Walbro's have 
	an adjustable main jet, unlike here.) If you look carefully you can see the 
	loop of magnet wire coming out of the top of the jet.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="How to Modify Jet Sizes in Small Engines" src="IMG_5843.JPG" width="448" height="336"></p>
	<p>Below is 
	the main jet from the Walbro above with 2 strands of magnet wire.&nbsp; The 
	loop is just visible in the upper left and is folded down next to the jet.&nbsp; 
	If it had been only a single strand that was needed, there would be coils at 
	both ends.&nbsp; The coils (about 1 mm in diameter) are visible to the lower 
	right.&nbsp; They should be centered over the hole in the jet.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="How to Modify Jet Sizes in Small Engines" src="IMG_5848.JPG" width="303" height="232"></p>
	<p>
Cut about 1½” of the wire needed so you have slack to work with.&nbsp; 
	If it is more than one strand, cut enough of the wire so that it will make 
	loops that are about 1½” long as in the photo below. This modification 
	required 2 strands of wire.&nbsp; The loop end, in this case, will be placed 
	at the particular end of the jet that has minimum space.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="How to Modify Jet Sizes in Small Engines" src="IMG_5851.JPG" width="448" height="336"></p>
	<p>If it 
	is only a single strand, you must first make a coil at one end similar to 
	the photo below by using a small drill bit (1/32” or smaller) or a 
	toothpick.&nbsp; If 2 wires are needed, you won't have to do this as the 
	loop will keep the wire from slipping out at that end.&nbsp; Now, feed the 
	wire through the jet.&nbsp; Take the wire that is now coming out and wrap it 
	around the drill bit a few times.&nbsp; You can work the wire so that the 
	coils are tight and close to the jet opening.&nbsp; Remove the bit.&nbsp; In 
	the photo below, there would ordinarily be a jet between the coils and the 
	loop but it is not shown here for clarity.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="How to Modify Jet Sizes in Small Engines" src="IMG_5852.JPG" width="448" height="336"></p>
	<p>Use a very fine pair of 
	wire cutters to trim all but 1 or 2 coils from the wire.</p>
	<h2>You’re done</h2>
	<p>CAREFULLY re-install the jet back into the carburetor.&nbsp; 
	The blade tip of the screwdriver can be manipulated around the magnet wire 
	with care so that the blade does not cut the wire.&nbsp; If necessary, use a 
	slightly smaller screwdriver.&nbsp; Make sure that the wire does not get 
	caught in the threads while inserting the jet into the carburetor housing.<br>
	&nbsp;<br>If you ever have to go back to the original jet size, it’s easy to fix.&nbsp; 
	If you make a mistake, just start over.<br>&nbsp;<br>Test run the engine to be 
	sure that you have not leaned out the mixture too far.&nbsp; Be sure not exceed the CHT of the engine!</p>
