	<h1>Safety Net Repair</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>If you must replace your 
	safety net, you will receive the new net only partially assembled.&nbsp; 
	This means you will have to measure the line lengths of the old net (if you 
	have one) so you can cut the new lines the correct lengths.&nbsp; Here are 
	some dimensions that will help the process.&nbsp; Use double half hitches 
	for knots and secure them with Superglue.&nbsp; Do not use the glue until 
	your net is completely assembled on the paramotor as you may need to make 
	some adjustments in the line lengths.&nbsp; You can mark the dimensions on 
	the lines with a black marker or Liquid Paper, as appropriate.</p>
	<p>Once the net is installed, use liquid (not gel) Superglue on all the 
	knots and the loose ends.&nbsp; Wait an hour and cut the loose ends off with 
	a pair of wire cutters.&nbsp; It makes a nice trim to the finished lines.</p>
	<p>Here is information on how to
	<a href="../safetynetstringing/safetynetstringing.htm">string the safety net</a>.&nbsp; 
	It is critical that the net not have holes big enough to get your hand 
	through it and that the net is tight enough so that a quick slap of the net 
	with your hand will not bring it close to the propeller.&nbsp; Suffice it to 
	say the REALLY dangerous parts of a propeller are the tips (I should 
	know...).&nbsp; This is where the netting is critical.&nbsp; Other parts of 
	a propeller can get tangled in hair and clothing and draw the pilot in to 
	the center  –  also not a pleasant experience.</p>
<p>(323) cm.  –  The total length of the line going around the inner 
circumference of the netting WITH ALL KNOTS.&nbsp; The dimension is from the 
loop on one karabiner to the loop on the other karabiner.&nbsp; Note that there 
are two more rings on the line (see notes on figure 2).&nbsp; It is easiest to 
put one karabiner on the line and the first ring per the instructions given in 
figure 2.&nbsp; String the line through the netting and then add the second ring and 
the last karabiner.&nbsp; You can work the knots to make the final dimensions 
correct.&nbsp; The line length is not critical.<br><br>Figure 1: (50) cm.  –  Total length of the 
	line to make the double looped lines which tension the net fabric on the 
	fiberglass rods.&nbsp; This dimension is before any knots are made in the 
line.&nbsp; Make the overhand knot in the double loop 
	at a point so that the double looped line pulls the net fabric enough to 
	completely cover the fiberglass rod and up to the frame.&nbsp; Put a knot in 
	the end of the doubled line AFTER the first knot is made adjusted so that it is easier to attach the doubled line to 
	the rivet on the frame.<br><br>Figure 2:&nbsp; (18) cm.  –  Distance between the end 
	ring/karabiner and the first ring on the long line that stretches the inside 
	circumference of the net.&nbsp; This is NOT the dimension of the line but 
the dimension AFTER the knots are made.&nbsp; It is a little easier to first tie 
	this long line to the end ring/karabiner and then make a mark on the line 
	(21) cm. from the middle of the end ring/karabiner.&nbsp; The line shortens 
about (3) cm. due to the knot.&nbsp; Slip the ring on the 
	line from the other end and tie a double half hitch so that the mark you 
	made is right at the ring.<br><br>Figure 3: (21) cm.  –  The distance from the line sewn 
	on the end of the net to the ring.&nbsp; This ring should 
	already be attached but the knot typically is not secured with Superglue.</p>
