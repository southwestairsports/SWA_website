	<h1>Redrive leaks</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<h2>How to detect where the leaks are</h2>
	<p>If you notice light-colored (not 
	black) oil around the base of your Miniplane engine, on the redrive or 
	muffler, you have a redrive leak.</p>
	<p>This is a NEW redrive that came from the factory without any sealant between the case halves.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the pilot was not a mechanic and thought either his fill or drain 
	plug was leaking and attempted to tighten it more.&nbsp; I pressure tested the redrive and oil came pouring out between the case halves.&nbsp; Depending on the ambient conditions, this type of leak can 
	sometimes be 
	hard to detect.</p>
	<p>An easy way to check for leaks, and where they are, is to take a heat gun and heat up the redrive quickly.&nbsp; This will pressurize the air inside it safely and heat up the oil.&nbsp; The oil will 
	leak out of the smallest crack.</p>
	<p><img alt="Top 80 leaking redrive - factory defect" height="768" src="DSCN4451_01.JPG" width="1024"></p>
	<p>Opening up the redrive, it was obvious why it leaked.</p>
	<blockquote><span class="italics">It was a Monday morning at the Miniplane factory in Italy after a wild weekend party -- lots of girls and plenty of booze.&nbsp; The technician (also a 
	relative of the boss) did not feel too good.&nbsp; When he looked at the new redrive case halves, it was hard to tell the difference between the flat surface of the case and the cavity.&nbsp; (He 
	was really thinking about the two rear halves of some babe at the party.)&nbsp; When he then put together the two case halves, everything was blurry, he had a headache, and could not be bothered with checking for the sealant squish 
	from between the halves when they are screwed together....</span></blockquote>
	<p>the red arrows in the photo below point to where he missed the edge when applying the sealant and it wound up in the cavity where it was useless. I do not know how else to explain such lack of quality control.&nbsp; They all must be making plenty of money over there and can't be bothered with the huge inconvenience of 
	the redrive oil leaking 
	and then going everywhere when some hapless pilot flies his new motor.&nbsp; This is to say nothing of cleaning up the mess and the cost to fix it all.&nbsp; It should be embarrassing to Miniplane 
	they do not make the slightest effort to ensure that the redrive cases are sealed properly, a test that might take all of 15 seconds in a production line.&nbsp; As usual, their reps deny 
	everything.&nbsp; If these motors did not have such good basic design, Miniplane would have long been out of business.&nbsp; If the Japanese ever start making paramotors, Miniplane will go the route of 
	Norton motorcycles, sigh....</p>

	<h2>Repairing leaks</h2>
	<p>Mark Kubisch has a good routine to r<a href="../../servicenotesbymarkkubisch/GearboxOverhaul.pdf">epair the redrive</a>, if needed.&nbsp; When reassembling the case halves, be certain to 
	tighten the screws in a "cross pattern" to the correct torque.&nbsp; Do NOT fill the case with oil for at least 8 or more hours to allow the sealant to cure.&nbsp; Use RTV "blue" or "grey" type.</p>
	<h2>Fill plug relief valve issues</h2>
	<p>Before you tear things apart (or 
	send it off for service), check to be sure the fill plug is not the problem. An easy to check the valve relief pressure is to use a pop-off gauge.&nbsp; 
	The plug is actually a low pressure relief valve (1.5 psi) that uses a spring loaded 
	ball pushing against an orifice.&nbsp; The ball can become stuck or jammed 
	over time preventing the relief of pressure buildup inside the redrive.&nbsp; 
	Pressure can increase enough to force oil out through the seals.&nbsp; The 
	increase in pressure can be caused by running the engine at full load (it 
	heats the redrive up more) or going to high altitude.&nbsp; The seals in 
	the redrive are not pressure seals but ordinary shaft seals which is why 
	they can leak under certain conditions.</p>
	<p>It is easy to fix the jammed 
	fill plug/relief valve.&nbsp; Cut the tip off a wood toothpick and run it 
	into the hole in the bottom of the plug pushing the ball back and forth.&nbsp; 
	You can tell right away if the ball is jammed.&nbsp; Spray some WD-40 down 
	the hole and then use air pressure to blow the WD-40 through the entire 
	relief valve.&nbsp; Doing this a number of times will thoroughly clean out 
	the valve.</p>
	<p>It is a good idea to check that the valve is not jammed 
	every time you change the redrive oil.</p>

	<h2>
	A better fill plug</h2>
	<p>
	If 
	you are a heavy 
	user of your Miniplane, you might want to consider doing away with&nbsp; the 
	factory supplied plug.&nbsp; Pilots who climb quickly to high altitudes or 
	run at full power in hot climates may find that cleaning the relief 
	valve/plug is insufficient to prevent oil leaks.&nbsp; When the pressure in 
	the redrive is greater than outside, the pressure will also tend to force 
	the seal tighter on the shaft  –  this excess pressure will wear the seal out 
	faster than normal.&nbsp; This is because the seals used are not 
	pressure-type seals.&nbsp; Miniplane uses this relief valve/plug so that the 
	motor can be stored in many positions without loss of redrive oil.&nbsp; 
	The vast majority of users, however, keep their paramotor in an upright 
	position.&nbsp; If you ship your Miniplane, for example, you can use the 
	original relief valve/plug.</p>
	<p>To prevent relative pressure 
	build up in the redrive use the plastic plug that was shipped with your 
	Miniplane.&nbsp; To make the plug a "breather" type, drill a tiny hole in 
	the center of the plug with a #60 drill.&nbsp; The small hole will let the 
	redrive breath but keep dust and other contaminants out. This simple 
	replacement plug will keep the pressure the same inside and outside the 
	redrive at all times.&nbsp; The downside is that it is MUCH easier to have an 
	oil spill if you lay the engine down so that the top slopes downhill.&nbsp; 
	It will slowly drain out and make a mess of your harness.&nbsp; When you 
	transport the engine, it is a good idea to put an unmodified plastic plug in 
	the redrive in order to prevent spills.</p>
