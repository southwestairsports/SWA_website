	B.
	<a href="../../general/torque-values.pdf">Torque Values</a> – here is a complete chart of the proper torque values for bolts into 
	steel and aluminum.&nbsp; Reduce all torque value by 50%<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with screws made ​​of aluminum or short threads in aluminum, 
	reduce torque by 60% with screws in plastic. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. WARNING: Socket button-head screws and studs CANNOT be torqued like ordinary bolts.&nbsp; Torque value is about 25% of the standard 
	value.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appropriate threadlock must always be used on these types of fasteners.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Threadlock 
	– There are (2) types of threadlock: "blue" for intermediate strength and "red" 
	for high strength.&nbsp; Most 
	hardware requires the blue.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red is much stronger and 
	hardware put together with red cannot be removed without heat.&nbsp; It is 
	important that studs inserted<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the engine case 
	be coated with red as the extreme vibration and shear loads will quickly 
	loosen them.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USE COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF BRAKE CLEANER AND COMPRESSED AIR TO CLEAN ALL SURFACES ASSEMBLED WITH THREADLOCK.</p>
	<p class="auto-style3">E. Engines running near or at sea level run hotter and have greater output which causes things to loosen, especially the cylinder head assembly.</p>

	cooling air duct, plastic washer, and locknut.&nbsp; Failure to get the order correctly will damage the cowling.&nbsp; The locknuts holding<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the air duct should be just 
	snug.&nbsp; If they are torqued down the same as the nuts beneath, they will damage the air duct.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DO NOT USE A CHEAP 1/4" CLICK-TYPE TORQUE WRENCH.&nbsp; USE A 1/4"

	properly can destroy the hub.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not over-tighten!&nbsp; Wooden propellers are 
	particularly prone to loosening and must be checked regularly.&nbsp; Replace the locking 
	nuts<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when they turn easily or use blue threadlock.&nbsp; 
	Make sure the rubber washer is under the outer 
	flange and NOT between the propeller<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the hub/spacer.<br>Prop hub center bolt 9-10 NM – it is important to use blue threadlock on this bolt.<br>Redrive nuts - 20 - 24 Nm&nbsp; When assembling be certain to <a href="clutch/clutch.htm">check the clutch for drag</a> before torqueing the nuts down.<br>Redrive fill &amp; drain plugs

	Note: if there is a CHT installed beneath the plug, this technique will not work.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of anti-seize compound is 
	optional.&nbsp; Be sure to use red threadlock on the spark plug terminal or 
	it WILL loosen.</p>
	<h2>Replacement/Check Intervals<span class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style2"> (from Miniplane's 	<a href="http://www.miniplane.com/inglese/manual/manuale.htm">maintenance 
	website</a> and other sources)</span></span></h2>
	<h3>General instructions</h3>
	<p>A. If the ignition and fuel systems are in order, engine 
	performance is directly related to engine compression.&nbsp; If the 
	compression is around 150 psi (at sea level), the engine top end is in good order.&nbsp; If this is the case, 
	replacing parts like the piston or piston ring is unnecessary.&nbsp; 
	Use of the best fuel (AVGAS) and oil (full-synthetic or semi-synthetic with the JASO FD and API TC classifications) will give your Top 80 the longest life before a major overhaul is necessary.&nbsp; 
	Use of gasoline with ethanol will increase engine maintenance and cause rapid deterioration of fuel system parts.&nbsp; It does not mix as well with fully synthetic oils.&nbsp; If you have to use 
	ethanol fuels, use a semi-synthetic oils.</p>
	<p>B. Maintenance schedules depend on how the engine is used.&nbsp; Thankfully, the engine is just a few inches from the pilot's head so he can monitor it closely.&nbsp; 
	Any growing ping type noise (the rattling of loose bearings) must be carefully noted as destruction of the upper piston rod bearing is a disaster.&nbsp; Top end failure might be an issue after 500 hours or more but few pilots put this amount of hours on their engines over a lifetime.</p>
	<p>C. Abused engines and those that experience fuel starvation can experience top end failure very quickly -- in just minutes.&nbsp; With that said, the weakest link in the Top 80 is the 
	ignition which <a href="troubleshooting/elecltroubleshooting.htm">must be checked</a> the moment a pilot senses a degradation in performance.&nbsp; Changing the spark plug is the cheapest and 
	easiest way to improve performance (assuming it is worn out).&nbsp; The 
	carburetor must be rebuilt and tested correctly.&nbsp; Stumbling due to fuel starvation will burn up an engine quickly and why the <a href="fuelsystemtest.htm">fuel test</a> must be done if problems 
	are suspected.&nbsp; The rest
	<a href="walbrowg8/popoff/pop-off-pressure.htm">pop-off pressure</a> must be within specifications for good idle and low-end performance.&nbsp; High pop-off pressure will cause the engine to run 
	lean and possibly burn it up.</p>
	<p>D. The reed valves should be <a href="reedvalve/ReedValve.htm">tested</a> and, if necessary, replaced if you find performance down a bit after a carb rebuild, a spark plug change, and find the 
	ignition system all in order.&nbsp; That is, the big maintenance items are the usual but if there are still issues, then we look at compression and things like the reed valves.</p>
	<p>I regularly do a compression test on my engines and record and compare the values to be sure the top end is in good shape.&nbsp; If it's 150 psi plus/minus 10% (at sea level) then it's a waste to replace the piston and cylinder. The 
	ignition and carburetor, in that order, are always the first things which fail on the Top 80.&nbsp; They must be regularly checked.</p>
	<p>Reed valve block – A <a href="reedvalve/ReedValve.htm">leak here</a> will cause the fuel pump to fail after the engine warms up.&nbsp; Use blue threadlock on these screws.&nbsp; Once you check 
	that the block is correctly torqued down, you will not have to check it again.&nbsp; Technicians at the Miniplane factory routinely do not properly torque down fasteners on new engines which is why pilots must check these things themselves.</p>
	<p>This maintenance schedule here is for average use.&nbsp; If you run at full power most of the time, fly near the ocean, or launch from sandy areas, you may to check things sooner and more 
	often.</p>
	<p>After the first 10 hours<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change the oil in the redrive<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give the paramotor a careful lookover for loose fittings, especially the motor 
	mount screws (both sides)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check the torque of the cylinder head nuts, especially if you run your engine at or near sea level.</p>
	<p>Every 25 hours<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spark plug – replace<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Muffler mounts – regularly check these to be sure they are not broken or 
	loose.&nbsp; The studs going into the crankcase<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	can loosen after many hours and chew up the aluminum threads.&nbsp; Use high 
	strength (red) threadlock on these studs.</p>
	<p>Every year (minimum) – Rebuild carburetor, including replacing the pop-off spring.&nbsp; Replace fuel filter, change the oil in the redrive,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; replace the spark plug, 
	and <a href="troubleshooting/elecltroubleshooting.htm#Secondary_Wire_Information">check the ignition</a>.&nbsp; Replace fuel system hoses if 
	ethanol gasoline is used.&nbsp; If the hoses are stiff, replace them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check the torque of the cylinder head nuts, especially if you run your engine at or near sea 
	level.</p>
	<p>Every 50 hours<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhaust flange gasket – Check for cracks and excessive wear.&nbsp; If there are 
	lots of black oil drips in the area, there is also an air leak<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it should be fixed.&nbsp; The flange gasket/cylinder head joint should be sealed with 
	high temp sealant e.g. Ultra Grey, as needed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This gasket gradually wears out and will crack 
	and leak if left on too long or if the exhaust flange springs are compressed too tightly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clutch – Examine for wear.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cylinder head and piston de-carbonizing – Be sure that the piston ring is 
	free and the groove is clean.&nbsp; A stuck ring will<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
	greatly affect performance and also tear up the cylinder.&nbsp; Stuck rings 
	are caused by engine overheating and/or cheap oil.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the 
	most important routine maintenance required on 2 stroke 
	engines, regardless of the fuel type used.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always replace the O-ring gasket if the head is removed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starter – Remove and lubricate center bushing with white lithium grease.&nbsp; DO NOT OVER LUBRICATE!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Redrive oil – drain &amp; replace.&nbsp; Be sure to clean the magnetic tip of 
	the drain plug and <a href="redriveleaks/redrive.htm">check the pressure relief valve</a>.<br><br>Every 100 hours<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clutch 
	links, springs, and the inner hub should be checked for excessive wear.&nbsp; If the links can be wiggled around, the clutch must be<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	removed and carefully examined for worn parts.&nbsp; Go to the <a href="clutch/clutch.htm">clutch page</a> for more details.&nbsp; Reassemble with anti-seize compound.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Compression check – this is the #1 way to know what condition the cylinder, piston, and rings are.&nbsp; If it is out of specs (above), replace<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	everything or pilots can also have their cylinders re-bored at <a href="http://www.rb-designs.com/rb_designs_llc_007.htm">this shop</a> for a modest price and get an oversized piston from 
	Miniplane-USA. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ignition secondary
	<a href="troubleshooting/elecltroubleshooting.htm#Secondary_Wire_Information">continuity check</a> -- you can expect the secondary wire to fail by this time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="redrivemountingstuds/redrive_mounting_stud_failure.htm">Re-drive studs</a> in the engine case&nbsp; 
	-- make sure they are not loose.&nbsp; These are SS and will fail after many hours and go into the prop!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Piston roller-cage bearing 
	replacement, if needed.&nbsp; Generally, if there is any knocking in the engine, this bearing must be checked/replaced.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Piston ring replacement, 
	if needed.&nbsp; If compression is down by over 10%, it is better to replace the piston, ring, and cylinder.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Prop bolts – check for tightness.&nbsp; Too tight is as bad 
	as too loose.<br><br>Every 150 hours<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hone cylinder (suggested by Miniplane) –&nbsp; Pilots can also have their cylinders re-bored/honed at
	<a href="http://www.rb-designs.com/rb_designs_llc_007.htm">this shop</a> for a modest price and get an oversized<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; piston from 
	Miniplane-USA, if needed.<br><br>Every 200 hours and more<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<a href="clutch/clutch.htm">Clutch</a> – if the clutch engages at idle or is noisy, the only practical solution is to replace it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cooling ductwork on engine – the 
	aluminum fins that are a part of the cooling box will eventually break loose.&nbsp; They are not critical parts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cooling fan check – Miniplane recommends replacing it but I am not sure why 
	this needs to be done.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crankcase oil seals – replace if leaking 
	beyond an acceptable amount.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frame – check it carefully for cracks.&nbsp; We have a competent shop here who can repair them.&nbsp; Most welding/muffler shops will ruin 
	your frame.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Piston – <a href="compressioncheck.htm">replace 
	if needed</a>.&nbsp; If there is a serious lack of power because of 
	wear, the cylinder will also need to be replaced/refurbished.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="reedvalve/ReedValve.htm">Reed valve petals</a> – replace (the engine will idle and start better).</p>
