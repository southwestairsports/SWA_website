	<h1>Spark plug specifications for the Top 80</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<ol>
		<li>DO NOT INSTALL A 
	NEW PLUG WITHOUT FIRST CHECKING THE GAP!</li>
		<li>The terminal cap on the top of the spark plug must be assembled with red or blue threadlock or it WILL LOOSEN!</li>
		<li>The 2mm spacer/washer must be installed beneath the spark plug.&nbsp; Failure to do so may damage the engine.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>These are the plugs recommended by Miniplane, the company that engineered 
	and manufactured the engine:</p>
	<blockquote>NGK B9ES or B9EG (cold running conditions)<br>NGK B10ES or B10EG (hot running 
	conditions)</blockquote>
	<p>"Hot running conditions" means heavy pilots (180 lbs.+) who run the 
	engine at full power for more than a few minutes at a time, especially at 
	sea level with ambient air temperature above 85 degrees F.&nbsp; "Cold 
	running conditions" means everything else.&nbsp; If you have any doubts, go 
	with the B10.&nbsp; If it runs "cold" the plug will foul more quickly.&nbsp; 
	If your spark plug is consistently black/sooty in color it mean that you 
	need a hotter running plug, e.g., the B9.&nbsp; Ignition and fuel system 
	problems can also cause the spark plug to foul.&nbsp; An overheating plug can also be caused by fuel starvation.</p>
	<p>Pilots may use NGK's Iridium line of plugs. They are better quality and 
	last longer but the cost difference is at least 3X the stock spark plug.&nbsp; 
	Some claim they give better performance.&nbsp; This is probably true over 
	the life of the plug.&nbsp; Nonetheless, they must be gapped and will also 
	foul just the same as the stock spark plug.&nbsp; Some non-NGK iridium plugs have 
	a special ground electrode that retards wear.&nbsp; If a pilot has to take 
	the plug out every 10 hours or so to check the gap anyway, why not spend a 
	few bucks and replace it with a new one?&nbsp; It will not have to be cleaned.</p>
	<p>Miniplane does not recommend the use of resistor type plugs (BR9ES, etc.) for the Top 80.&nbsp; Some pilots report that they have less radio interference caused by ignition noise when using 
	resistor type plugs but these plugs will result in lower performance.</p>
	<p>Electrode gap is 0.5-0.6 mm (.020”-.024”).&nbsp; The gap should always be 
	set to the minimum value because the gap widens as the plug is used.&nbsp; 
	Excessive gap will cause the engine to miss at high loads and make it harder to start.&nbsp; Be certain 
	the spark plug is gapped properly.&nbsp; Check the gap every 
	7-10 hours and adjust as necessary.&nbsp; Pilots would be surprised at how 
	fast the gap changes on these high performance engines.</p>
	<p><span class="bold">IMPORTANT</span>&nbsp; When replacing the spark plug with a new one, 
	use red (best) or blue threadlock on the top terminal and firmly screw it down on the threaded tip of the plug.&nbsp;  
	If the upper terminal gets loose (which is usually does after many hours of 
	use), it will wreck its threads, come free, and then become embedded in the 
	end of the boot.&nbsp; A loose terminal in the boot will not contact the plug 
	properly and cause missing at high loads.&nbsp; Pilots would not believe how 
	often I find <a href="https://youtu.be/CVCsbA-Il7E">this problem</a> when working on motors and it illustrates my point.</p>
	<p>Torque -- see the <a href="../specsTop80.htm">specifications</a> page.&nbsp; If the spark plug is not torqued down properly it will LEAK 
	at high loads.&nbsp; You will notice this by reduced top end  
	power and black gunk around the base of the plug.&nbsp; Be extremely careful 
	in not over-torqueing the spark plug!</p>
	<p>Be certain when reconnecting the secondary wire that you 
	FIRMLY push down on the boot as far as it will go.&nbsp; Twisting it gently 
	as you push down will help.&nbsp; If the boot is not fully pushed on, the 
	spark will fail under high load and the engine will miss and/or experience a 
	loss of power.&nbsp; It is always best to coat the inside of the boot and 
	top of the plug with
	<a href="http://www.autozone.com/greases-and-gear-oil/lubricant-grease/ags-single-use-pouch-spark-plug-grease/196157_0_0/">
	spark plug grease</a>.&nbsp; The grease will permit the boot to be firmly 
	seated and lessen wear of the boot, a common problem.&nbsp; As the boot wears, pilots will 
	notice this by an abundance of black soot (pulverized rubber) inside the 
	boot and on the terminal of the spark plug.&nbsp; If pilots
	<a href="../secondarywirereplacement/sec_repl.htm">replace the secondary 
	wire and boot</a> with an automotive quality boot and heavy duty wire, the system will last at least four or five times as long.</p>
	<p>Do not forget to place the 2 mm washer underneath the spark 
	plug.&nbsp; The washer lowers the compression and engine running temperature to an acceptable level.&nbsp; Failure to use the washer will damage the engine.&nbsp; Use a 2.5 or 3.0 mm washer if you must use low 
	octane/poor quality fuel.&nbsp; These washers can be purchased from
	<a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/parts/ignition.htm">Miniplane USA</a>.&nbsp; 
	Remember that a cooler running and lower compression engine will last longer.&nbsp; Heat kills 
	small engines.&nbsp; The higher the output of an engine, the shorter its life.</p>
	<p>Poor performance, poor idle, weak top end, etc. are 
	most often caused by a worn out spark plug or a failed secondary wire (see 
	below).</p>
	<p id="spark_plug_w_lead_deposits">The spark plug below is in normal condition after about 20 hours of use.&nbsp; Lead 
	deposits (from AVGAS without the TCP additive) are a light yellow whereas unleaded fuel deposits are 
	brownish/black.&nbsp; If deposits anywhere in the engine are black and 
	gummy, pilots should use higher quality fuel and/or oil and be certain that 
	the engine is not overheating.&nbsp; The plug is clean (no soot).&nbsp; Nonetheless, this 
	plug is worn out and should be replaced.&nbsp; This can be observed by the 
	rounded edges of the inner electrode.&nbsp; Plugs will soot up very quickly 
	at idle which is why pilots should keep idling to a minimum.&nbsp; In order to check the general condition of your ignition system, 
	run your engine at full power in the air for a few minutes, kill it at full 
	power, and then land "dead stick".&nbsp; This is the only way you can get an 
	accurate idea of the condition of your fuel and ignition systems.&nbsp; Read this <a href="../fueloilspecs/fuelOil.htm">article</a> 
	on how to use AVGAS (a superior fuel) over the long term in two stroke engines.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;<img alt="healthy spark plug from an engine using AVGAS" src="DSC01321.JPG" width="512" height="366"></p>
	<p>Below is a spark plug from an engine that used AVGAS without the TCP additive.&nbsp; This plug was way overdue to be changed but still was in good enough condition to start the engine.&nbsp; 
	It shows how the lead oxide deposits build up.&nbsp; To a 
	lesser extent, the top of the piston is covered with these deposits but they are easily removed.&nbsp; Contrary to rumors that circulate on the Miniplane blogs, lead oxide rarely causes the piston 
	ring to stick to the lands more than ordinary carbon deposits.&nbsp; AVGAS is a superior fuel that, among other things, does not lose its octane value after a few weeks.&nbsp; Your engine will 
	never knock using AVGAS.&nbsp; The engine from which this plug was removed had no problem with a stuck ring.&nbsp; It just needed the usual routine head and 
	piston cleaning that must be done on all engines regardless of fuel type used.&nbsp; However, if an engine overheats, it does not matter what kind of fuel is used: the ring will have a much 
	greater chance of sticking because of the presence of burned oil.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;<img alt="spark plug fouled by the presence of led in aviation gasoline" height="709" src="DSCN4037%20-%20Copy.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>The spark plug below was run in an engine that used premium unleaded, ethanol free, gasoline.&nbsp; It is a tiny bit fouled from many hours of use but still works just fine.&nbsp; Note that the 
	electrodes have sharp edges which means the plug is not very old.&nbsp; Always check the gap.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="spark plug used with unleaded premium fuel" src="DSCN2841-512PIX.JPG" width="512" height="584"></p>
	<p>
	Here is a spark plug from an engine using AVGAS with the addition of the TCP additive.&nbsp; There is a small amount of lead oxide present on the white insulator.&nbsp; The plug has about 10 hours 
	on it.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="AVGAS spark plug with TCP additive" height="589" src="DSCN4871copy.JPG" width="640">&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Performance of the engine at the 
	top end is everything per evaluating its condition.&nbsp; If anything is wrong with any part of the 
	ignition or fuel system, the engine will not achieve maximum power output.&nbsp; 
	Generally, always be careful running your engine at full throttle for long 
	periods of time, especially if you are near sea level.&nbsp;&nbsp; Install a <a href="../CHT/cht.htm">CHT</a> so that you can have some idea of the engine's normal operating conditions.&nbsp; 
	Monitoring the running temperature of the engine can alert pilots of potential disaster.</p>
	<p>Here is the perfect spark plug color and condition.&nbsp; It is a few hours old and is in the right heat range (inner insulator is off-white not bleached white).&nbsp; AVGAS was used with the 
	addition of the TCP fuel additive (almost eliminates lead deposits).&nbsp; Note the the sharp edges of the center electrode.&nbsp; This is how you know the plug has not been in the engine long.&nbsp; The 
	center tip gets more rounded as the plug is used.</p>

	<p>Remember that a cooler running engine will last longer.&nbsp; Heat kills small engines!&nbsp; Keep this in mind when tuning the Top 80.<br></p>
