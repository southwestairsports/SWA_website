	<h1>Throttle Cable Assembly</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>NEVER USE ANY TYPE OF PETROLEUM BASED LUBRICANTS ON THE THROTTLE CABLE.&nbsp; All this will do is gum things up and make problems worse.</p>
	<p>Use  
	powdered graphite ONLY.&nbsp; "Liquid Graphite" a.k.a. "lock fluid" does more harm than good because the solvent in it does not 
	evaporates completely and forms gum.&nbsp; To lubricate the 
	cable properly, the throttle must be disassembled and the inner 
	cable removed.&nbsp; Do not be concerned about replacing the 
	shrink wrap on the hand throttle assembly.&nbsp; It is for cosmetic purposes 
	only.</p>
	<p>The Bowden cable must never be bent sharply or it will be ruined.&nbsp; 
	Ensure that the cable has smooth turns from end to end.&nbsp; Sharp turns 
	increase friction and make the throttle harder to operate.</p>
	<p>As your throttle cable ages, friction between the inner cable and the sheath increases.&nbsp; This is caused by wear and/or dirt.&nbsp; 
	Dirt is a particular problem if the cable was ever lubricated with anything other than pure graphite.</p>
	<p>Sometimes, the throttle cable will stick completely.&nbsp; Rather than buy 
	an entire new throttle cable assembly, pilots can replace the inner cable, 
	an item readily available from any bike repair shop for about $5.&nbsp; A 
	local shop can do the whole job which involves cleaning the inside of the 
	sheath and replacing the inner cable.&nbsp; They can also replace 
	the entire Bowden cable itself.</p>
	<p>The inner cable will last 50 - 100 hours.&nbsp; When replacing the cable, be sure to thoroughly clean every 
	trace of debris, grease, and oil from cable housing.&nbsp; 
	Over time, the Teflon coating of the cable wears off and the little pieces 
	can jam the inner cable.</p>
	<h2>1. Checking the cable for damage</h2>
	<p>With normal use, the cable will rub on various parts of the frame.&nbsp; If the cable has not been protected at these contact points by wrapping it with electrical tape or a piece of split 
	hose, the kill switch wire can short to ground.&nbsp; This will cause an engine shutdown at unexpected times.&nbsp; In extreme cases, the cable itself can wear through to the inner wire and the 
	throttle can jam or cease to function!</p>
	<p>Carefully examine the entire length of the cable for damage.&nbsp; Apply tape or hose to those areas where the cable rubs any part of the frame.</p>
	<h2 id="Cleaning_the_Throttle_Cable">2. Cleaning the throttle cable</h2>
	<p>To thoroughly clean the cable:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Remove the cable from the paramotor and disassemble.&nbsp; 
		This will involve cutting and removing the shrink wrap at the throttle 
		end of the cable.&nbsp; New shrink wrap can be found at Harbor Freight 
		but it is an unnecessary chore as the shrink wrap is for cosmetic 
		purposes only.</li>
		<li>Be sure the inner cable can move back and forth.</li>
		<li>Suspend the empty sheath above a pan.</li>
		<li>Using a medicine dropper or turkey baster, drip paint thinner 
		(mineral spirits) on the inner cable at the hand throttle end while working 
		it back and forth (up and down) in the sheath.&nbsp; Continue 
		to do this until the paint thinner drips out the other end and is clear.</li>
		<li>Remove the inner cable.</li>
		<li>Thoroughly remove the mineral spirits in the sheath with compressed air and a hot air gun/hair dryer.</li>
		<li>Replace the inner cable (or use the original if it is good condition).</li>
		<li>If the inner cable is not Teflon coated, use graphite powder on it 
		liberally while you reinsert it.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Quality Bowden cables will have an inner sleeve that reduces friction 
	between the inner cable and the sheath.&nbsp; In addition, a 
	quality inner cable will be Teflon coated.&nbsp; These cables do not need any 
	form of lubrication and will work smoothly until they are worn out.</p>
	<p>Pilots who fly often will also appreciate
	this <a href="../throttlespring/throttlespring.htm">throttle spring modification</a> 
	which 
	decreases the pull on the throttle, lessens throttle shaft bore wear, and 
	provides a more positive return of the throttle to the idle position.</p>
	<h2>3. Throttle cable end attachment modification</h2>
	<p>The inner throttle cable will last much longer if this modification is done 
	where it attaches to the carburetor.&nbsp; It also provides a much more 
	convenient way to disconnect the throttle cable from the carburetor.&nbsp; 
	Instead of removing the knarp and losing the cable adjustment, the ends of 
	the cotter pin are bent together and quickly removed from the the throttle lever.&nbsp; A new cotter pin should be used, 
	however, as bending it more than once or twice will weaken it.</p>
	<p>Parts needed: (1) knarp - use the existing one; (1) thin piece of sheet 
	metal; (1) small cotter pin.&nbsp; The correct size knarp a.k.a. "throttle clamp" is available from <a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/parts/throttle.htm">Miniplane-USA</a> if yours is missing 
	or damaged.</p>
	<p>Make the small bracket of out sheet metal as pictured here.&nbsp; Drill 
	two holes, one just bigger than the cable and the other just bigger than 
	cotter pin.&nbsp; Then bend the sheet metal into an "L".</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Top 80 throttle cable attachment modification parts" src="DSCN3098_01.JPG" width="800" height="600"></p>
	<p>The cotter pin must be shortened so that when it is pushed through the 
	new bracket and throttle lever, it will not catch on 
	other parts.&nbsp; Be sure to check for free movement of the throttle cable.&nbsp; Failure to thoroughly check the throttle cable for free movement can result in a stuck throttle which can be 
	EXTREMELY dangerous!&nbsp; 
	This modification can be used with the
	<a href="../throttlespring/throttlespring.htm">throttle spring modification</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="Cruise_Control">4. Cruise control<br></h2>
	<p>A pilot in England asked me about modifying the stock throttle for 
	cruise control.&nbsp; After thinking about it, I do not recommend it.&nbsp; 
	Runaway engines and emergency shutdowns are conditions that require instant 
	control of the throttle and a cruise control adds more complexity to a 
	cascading event such as a <a href="http://usppamembers.org/incidents/incident_view_only_public.cfm?key=1775.70864&amp;myYear=2015">stuck cruise control</a>, a faulty kill switch, a broken throttle spring, or 
	a glider deflation.&nbsp; The pilot who had the stuck cruise control rolled his trike and did a lot of damage (propeller, cage, etc.)&nbsp; What if his lines to the glider had gotten into the 
	spinning propeller?&nbsp; Think about this sort of thing before making modifications to your throttle.</p>
	<p>Lines getting caught in a spinning propeller?&nbsp; Anyone who has experienced a runaway engine knows what I am talking about.&nbsp; It is terrifying.&nbsp; However, if the above throttle spring modification is done 
	(applies to most paramotors), 
	throttle pressure is greatly lessened and will be much more comfortable when flying for many hours.</p>
	<p>For those wishing for a way to construct a cruise control, I would modify the existing throttle pivot (drill it out) and insert a screw with a plastic knurled knob.&nbsp; Shortening the pivot 
	will allow the throttle halves to be squeezed together by the knob and screw enough to lock it.</p>
	<h2>5. Kill switch</h2>
	<p>See the <a href="../killswitch/killswitch.htm">kill switch info</a> section 
	on how to troubleshoot kill switch problems related to the cable and the throttle assembly.</p>
