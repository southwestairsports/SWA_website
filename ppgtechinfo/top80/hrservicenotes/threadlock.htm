	<h1>Threadlock</h1>
	<p>Threadlock is a special type of glue that helps keep threaded parts from loosening.&nbsp; Small 2 cycle aircraft engines experience tremendous vibration because they are made as light as 
	possible.&nbsp; The vibration will loosen fittings after just a few hours of running time.&nbsp; Vibration will also cause various sheet metal parts to flex and eventually break from fatigue and 
	pilots should always be on the lookout for cracks in aluminum parts of their paramotors, including in the frame.</p>
	<p>There are various types of threadlock.&nbsp; The type known as "red" is the strongest threadlock.&nbsp; Threaded parts that are assembled with "red" can only be disassembled by using high heat, 
	as in a torch, to dissolve the bond.&nbsp; It should be used on threaded studs that are inserted into the engine case.&nbsp; This includes the studs that hold the redrive on and the exhaust 
	manifold studs that screw into the cylinder head.&nbsp; The most common threadlock is "blue".&nbsp; Parts that are assembled with "blue" can be disassembled with ordinary tools.&nbsp; Another type 
	is "green" and is known as "wicking grade" threadlock.&nbsp; This type can be used on threaded assemblies that are already put together.</p>
	<p>Threadlock should be applied to absolutely clean threads.&nbsp; Pilots should clean ALL parts prior to assembly with ordinary spray type brake cleaner that is available from any auto parts 
	store.&nbsp; Compressed air (or computer dust cleaner) should be used to remove every trace of the brake cleaner before the threadlock is applied.&nbsp; Tighten all fittings to the recommended 
	torque value. </p>
	<p>Miniplane RECOMMENDS 
	that ALL nuts and bolts be assembled using medium strength ("blue") thread 
	locking compound (e.g. Locktite 242).&nbsp; Failure to use thread lock will 
	invariably result in things falling apart at the most inconvenient time.</p>
	<p>Note: Important parts of the Top 80 are NOT assembled with threadlock at the factory.&nbsp; Pilots MUST be certain to reassemble the redrive and exhaust manifold studs with "red" threadlock.</p>
	<p>Here is a <a href="../DSCN0916_01.JPG">photo</a> of what can happen when bolts get loose.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, do 
	not use these compounds on the cylinder head nuts or the spark plug.&nbsp;</p>
