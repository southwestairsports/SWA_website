	<h1>Engine Break-In</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>Proper break-in will provide 
	you with a better running engine and considerably longer engine life.&nbsp; 
	Most engines are not properly broken in.&nbsp; It takes time.&nbsp; Remember 
	that running at full throttle on a new engine for more than brief periods 
	should not be done.<br><br>The break-in procedure can be done with the 
	paramotor on your back.&nbsp; It is a GOOD time for you to become more 
	familiar with the feel and sound of your paramotor.&nbsp; While doing the 
	break-in fiddle with items around you like the buckles, the choke, etc.&nbsp; 
	The more the throttle is second nature, the safer pilot you will be.<br><br>
	Do not increase the amount of oil in the fuel during the break-in period.&nbsp; 
	As Polini and other engine manufacturers note in their user manuals, it does nothing to improve the 
	lubrication of the engine.&nbsp; Instead, it will cause the engine to run 
	hotter (leaner), even causing it to seize.</p>
	<p>A new engine generates a lot 
	more friction (heat) because the moving parts of the engine have tighter 
	clearances. It can more easily seize than an engine with many hours.&nbsp; 
	The break-in procedure allows the space between moving parts to increase 
	slightly to the designed value.&nbsp; If your engine suddenly starts to lose 
	power, it is probably overheating.&nbsp; Immediately back off on the 
	throttle to idle.&nbsp; This break-in procedure is a little more 
	detailed than the official Miniplane procedure and can be used with other 
	engines.&nbsp; <br>.<br>The procedure listed below takes less than 30 minutes and is done on the ground.&nbsp; After this is done, you can fly.</p>
	<p>Put the engine on your back and take a walk.&nbsp; Not only will you break the engine in but you will get 
	used to it being on your back.&nbsp; If you have a <a href="CHT/cht.htm">CHT</a> installed, keep the temperature well below the specified maximums.</p>
	<ol>
		<li class="il-padding-dot2em">Start the engine and let it idle until it is up to normal running temperature (cooling fins too hot to touch).&nbsp; Idle it for another (10) minutes.</li>
		<li class="il-padding-dot2em">Vary the RPM to 1/2 throttle and back to idle for 2 minutes.&nbsp; 
	Stop the engine and let it cool off for 2 minutes.</li>
		<li class="il-padding-dot2em">Start the engine.&nbsp; Vary the RPM from idle to 1/2 throttle and back for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Stop the engine and let it cool off 
	for 5 minutes. </li>
		<li class="il-padding-dot2em">Start the engine.&nbsp; Vary the RPM from idle to full throttle (briefly) for 10 minutes.&nbsp; 
	Stop the engine and let it cool off for 5 minutes. </li>
		<li class="il-padding-dot2em">Continue 10 
	minutes of running, 5 minutes of cooling until 30 minutes of total run time 
	is achieved.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>At this point, you can fly.&nbsp; Avoid full power for more 
	than (5) minutes and vary the throttle often during the break-in period.</p>
	<p>Break-in is complete after a full tank (10 liters/2.6 gallons) of fuel have been 
	run through the engine.&nbsp; Polini and Minari note that break-in is complete after 
	two tanks (20 liters) of fuel has been consumed.&nbsp; If it were my engine, I would be really easy on it until (20) liters of fuel have been consumed.</p>
	<p>All engines should have the head bolts/nuts checked after the first (10) hours of use.&nbsp; For the proper torque value, check the respective specification page of your engine.&nbsp; The Top 
	80 value is 9 Nm.</p>
