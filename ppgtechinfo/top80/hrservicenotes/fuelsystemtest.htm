	<h1>Fuel system test</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>Here are some tests to see if your fuel system is in working order.&nbsp; If you need to, you can refer to these diagrams to identify the parts of the carburetor that you have:&nbsp;
	<a href="walbrowg8/WG8_explode.gif">WG-8</a>&nbsp; <a href="../../wb37/wb37.htm">WB-37</a>.</p>
	<p>NOTE: ALL CARBURETORS SHOULD BE REBUILT EVERY YEAR WHETHER THE ENGINE IS RUN OR NOT.</p>
	<p>If there are fuel delivery problems when the engine is running under load (in the air), check to be sure that the reed valve mounting screws are properly torqued down to specs (4-5 Nm).&nbsp; If the reed valve is 
	loose, the fuel pump will not work properly, if at all.</p>
	<h2>1.&nbsp; Carburetor high speed system</h2>
	<p>
	All engines except the Minari:
Remove the air 
	box but not the airbox junction.&nbsp; Tilt the engine to the air box side.&nbsp; Blow into the priming 
	tube while pushing down on the fuel metering lever release button on the 
	side of the carburetor.&nbsp; (This is how you prime the carburetor.)&nbsp; 
	Hold the pressure until fuel runs out of the carburetor.&nbsp; If it runs 
	freely out in a small stream you will know that the filters and passageways 
	right up to and including the main jet are mostly clear and working.&nbsp; 
	THIS WILL NOT TEST THE FUEL PUMP!&nbsp; (To test the fuel pump see #3 below.)&nbsp; 
	You could still have obstructions in the slow and intermediate speed 
	systems.&nbsp; Problems there will cause the engine to idle poorly, if at 
	all.&nbsp; Once you release the priming lever and pressure in the fuel tank, 
	fuel should remain in the fuel lines.&nbsp; If the fuel runs back into the 
	tank (sudden appearance of air in the lines), there is a problem with the 
	check valves in the fuel pump.&nbsp; Your engine will not idle properly and 
	it will be hard to start.&nbsp; You will need to rebuild your carburetor if 
	this happens.&nbsp; Note: For a thorough test of the fuel system, see #3 
	below.</p>
	<p>
	For the Minari: See the "<a href="performanceissues/performance_issues.htm">Quick fuel system tests</a>" on this page and run them.</p>
	<h2>2.&nbsp; Carburetor low speed systems</h2>
	<p>
	To check whether the low speed system is OK (up to but not including the jets) just unscrew the idle adjustment screw and remove it.&nbsp; Be sure to first 
	gently screw it in while counting the number of turns so that you can later 
	return it to its original setting.&nbsp; Now, prime the carburetor as above.&nbsp; 
	Fuel should dribble out of the idle screw hole as well as from the main jet 
	inside the carburetor.&nbsp; For the Minari, the throttle must be tied or taped to the wide open position so that the excess fuel that dribbles into the engine can better evaporate and not flood 
	it.&nbsp; Keep the time that you prime the system as SHORT as possible.</p>
	<h2>3.&nbsp;Fuel pump and filters</h2>
	<p>
	The fuel pump works by means of the rapidly changing pressure in the crankcase every time the piston goes up and down.&nbsp; This pressure is transferred through a series of passageways to one 
	side of the fuel pump diaphragm which, in turn, moves it up and down.&nbsp; This movement creates a suction and pressure action which moves fuel into the carburetor and to the metering lever 
	valve.&nbsp; Leaks, clogs, or misalignment of the carburetor gasket can prevent the pulses from the engine reaching the fuel pump.</p>
	<p>
A problem with the fuel 
	pump or the filters will cause things like high end fade after a few minutes 
	(even up to 10 minutes or more), hard starting, and the presence of air in 
	the fuel lines.&nbsp; IF THIS IS NOT REPAIRED, THE ENGINE WILL OVERHEAT AND 
	MAY BE DAMAGED.</p>
	<h3>
	Filter test</h3>
	<p>
	There are usually three filters: the fuel pickup tube filter, the main inline filter, and the filter inlet screen (in the carburetor).&nbsp; To check the condition of all of the fuel filters, 
	remove the metering diaphragm cover, the diaphragm, and the metering lever assembly.&nbsp; It is easy to drop/lose the interior parts of the carburetor so be careful.&nbsp; Make sure there is fuel in the tank.</p>
	<p>
	Pressurize the fuel tank by blowing on the priming pipe and holding the pressure with the tip of the tongue.&nbsp; If 
	fuel moves up and through the fuel lines and bubbles out of the inlet needle valve hole, skip to the "pump test" and continue the test.&nbsp; This test will not flood the engine, including the 
	Minari.</p>
	<p>
	If 
	not, detach the fuel line 
	that goes into the carburetor and pressurize the tank again.&nbsp; If fuel 
	does not flow out of the open fuel line, you have either a clogged inline filter (the main filter) and/or a clogged fuel pickup tube filter.&nbsp; If 
	fuel dribbles freely out of the detached fuel line, the inlet filter screen in the carburetor is probably clogged.&nbsp; This will require a complete disassembly and repair of the carburetor.</p>
	<p>
	Other things that could stop fuel movement are:&nbsp; a collapsed fuel line, a faulty check valve at the quick disconnect on the tank, or debris in the fuel line somewhere.</p>
	<p>
	If a top grade inline filter is not used, it is common that the fuel inlet filter screen will become clogged with fine particles.</p>
	<h3>
	Pump test</h3>
	<p>
	Before doing this test, be sure to do the filter test above and leave the carburetor disassembled (the metering lever assembly must be removed).&nbsp; If the filters or fuel lines are clogged, the fuel pump cannot do its job.&nbsp; 
	For the Top 80 ONLY: The airbox junction must be attached to the 
	carburetor.&nbsp; If the carburetor is loose, the pump will not receive any pressure pulses from the crankcase and it will not pump fuel.</p>
	<p>
	To test the fuel pump, drain all but a 
	few inches of fuel from the tank (this will thoroughly test the&nbsp; pump).&nbsp; Reattach the fuel line to the carburetor, if removed.&nbsp;
	Remove the spark plug then reattach it to the plug wire.&nbsp; Lay the 
	spark plug on top of the engine so that it touches the aluminum cooling fins 
	(this grounds the spark plug).&nbsp; If you do not do this, you may destroy 
	your ignition coil.&nbsp; So that you do not wear out the starter, prime the carburetor in the usual way so that fuel dribbles out of the inlet needle valve hole.&nbsp; Now, pull on the starter.&nbsp; You should see fuel 
	spurt out of the inlet needle valve hole just like a squirt-gun for a yard/meter or so.&nbsp;  
	Here is a <a href="http://youtu.be/4OYsxtz2080">video</a> of what it should look like.&nbsp; Every time the piston 
	goes and up and down, a solid stream of fuel should come out of the hole.<br><br>Warning for Top 80 engines : if the <a href="reedvalve/ReedValve.htm">reed valve body</a> is even slightly loose, the fuel pump may pass this test but when the engine warms 
	up and is under load (flying), the pump may fail.&nbsp; Check the mounting screws for the reed valve body that they are torqued to specs.&nbsp; Threadlock MUST be used on these screws!</p>
	<p>
	After the test, be certain that no bubbles can be seen moving slowly back 
	down through the fuel line towards the fuel filter and tank.&nbsp; Movement 
	of air bubbles indicates a failure of the check valves in the fuel pump and 
	you will have to rebuild the carburetor.&nbsp; Ethanol in the gasoline is very hard on the fuel pump diaphragm material.&nbsp; If all is well, put 
	everything back carefully.</p>
	<p>
	Note that it is normal to have bubbles in 
	the fuel line.&nbsp; It is fuel vapor, not air (unless you have a
	<a href="fuelsystemleaks/fuelsystemleaks.htm">leak in your fuel filter</a>).</p>
	<p>
	If there is no fuel flow or it is poor (a dribble and not a powerful spurt), the carburetor needs to be rebuilt.</p>
	<p>
	Rarely, the cause of no fuel flow can be due to no pulse reaching the fuel pump from the crankcase.&nbsp; Check to be sure the fuel pump port into the crankcase is clear and 
	free of any gasket sealant.</p>
	<p>
	For the Top 80 ONLY: The carburetor will have to be 
	removed to check this.&nbsp; Be certain that the gasket between the carburetor and the reed valve body has the pump port hole lined up with the holes in the reed valve and the carburetor.&nbsp; At 
	the same time, check the torque on the reed body mounting screws.&nbsp; These screws should have blue threadlock applied to them.</p>
	<p>
	If things look good to this point, you can 
	check the fuel pump suction with a vacuum gauge (sold at auto parts stores).&nbsp; The value should be what is 
	given on our
	<a href="specsTop80.htm">specifications</a> page.&nbsp; If it is below the specified value, you will 
	have to rebuild your carburetor.</p>
	<h2>General</h2>
	<p>If the engine starts 
	and then stalls after a minute or two, you probably have a problem with the 
	fuel pump diaphragm or check valves in the pump.&nbsp; Ethanol blends will 
	quickly
	<a href="fueloilspecs/fuelOil.htm">stiffen soft carburetor parts</a> that are not specifically manufactured to 
	withstand powerful solvents like ethanol.&nbsp; Generally, carburetors 
	should be rebuilt every year because of problems with the check valves that 
	are a part of the pump diaphragm.&nbsp; Age and warping from solvents in gasoline are big factors in causing the valves 
	to leak.&nbsp; Rebuild kits are available from
	<a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/pages/parts.htm">Miniplane-USA</a>.<br>
	<br>After you perform these tests, remember to be sure to see if any air bubbles appear in the fuel line right where it is attached to the carburetor.&nbsp; Look at it for about 15 seconds.&nbsp; 
	If you see any bubbles moving up and out of the carburetor, through the fuel line, and then back down into the tank, you will most likely have to rebuild the carburetor because the pump check 
	valves are not working.</p>
