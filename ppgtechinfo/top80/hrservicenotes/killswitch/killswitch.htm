	<h1>Kill switch problems</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>Failure of the kill 
	switch is more than just a nuisance,  it is a safety issue, as well.</p>
	<h2>How it operates</h2>
	<p>The principle of the switch is to ground the primary 
	winding of the ignition coil which will kill the spark and stop the engine.&nbsp; 
	The actual kill switch is a simple button.&nbsp; Though cheaply made, it is 
	relatively immune from failure.&nbsp; The circuit uses the steel Bowden 
	cable that runs to the throttle as the ground.&nbsp; A wire is run up to the 
	throttle and kill switch (button) from the primary wire coming out of the 
	coil.&nbsp; There may be a short extension of the wire so that it reach the 
	connector on the wire going to the throttle.&nbsp; The kill switch wire 
	enters the wire loom near the throttle cable's connection to the motor 
	frame.&nbsp; It then extends up to the throttle between the loom and Bowden 
	cable.&nbsp; The wire continues inside the throttle and is soldered to one 
	of the terminals on the kill switch.&nbsp; A wire runs from the other 
	terminal on the switch to the throttle end of the Bowden cable.&nbsp; It is 
	secured by a narrow piece of polyvinyl tubing.&nbsp; The connection is not 
	particularly sound but it works.</p>
	<h2>Points of failure</h2>
	<h3>Defective wire</h3>
	<p>The most common 
	failure of the circuit are defects in the wire itself.&nbsp; This continues (!) to be a quality 
	control (QC) issue with the manufacturer of the wire.&nbsp; What happens is that the wire is likely stretched to the point of breaking or the wire is stressed over a sharp object essentially 
	cutting it as the outer insulation is being applied.&nbsp; It seems to happen in batches.&nbsp; One pilot's new Miniplane had (2) separate breaks in the kill switch wire.&nbsp; What is 
	particularly annoying is that the circuit will work for awhile because the broken ends of the wire will touch.&nbsp; However, when the throttle cable is moved repeatedly, it will stretch a small 
	amount which is just enough to cause the circuit to fail.&nbsp; The pilot has no warning except when he attempts to shut off the engine.&nbsp; I have been working with hookup wire for many decades 
	and have never seen this problem except with Italian made wire.&nbsp; I am still in disbelief that Italian QC is so poor.</p>
	<p>To improve safety and convenience, it is highly recommended that all pilots <a href="../../../thor130200/choke/choke_control.htm">install a choke control</a> if there is not already one 
	installed e.g. on the Polini's.</p>
	<p>If the motor is new, a warranty 
	replacement of the entire throttle cable can be done.&nbsp; If your kill 
	switch has failed and you are past the warranty period, plan on spending at 
	least an hour to fix the problem.&nbsp; Having the right tools is essential.</p>
	<h3>Frame attachment point</h3>
	<p>Another point of failure is where the throttle cable attaches to the 
	frame.&nbsp; Miniplane recommends that the cable not be connected tightly so 
	that it can move.&nbsp; Unfortunately, rust and grime will spoil the 
	connection between the throttle cable and electrical ground.&nbsp; The 
	result is that the kill switch will work intermittently.&nbsp; It is a 
	trade-off.&nbsp; I suggest that pilots firmly tighten the nuts which connect 
	the throttle cable to the frame.</p>
	<p>Below is a Top 80 that had 
	intermittent kill switch failure.&nbsp; It was traced to the rust around the 
	(properly) loose fitted cable connection.&nbsp; Tightening the nut securely 
	eliminated the problem.&nbsp; Make sure that the cable is lined up properly 
	if you tighten this fitting.&nbsp; For the obsessive-compulsive: add a 
	second thin nut to the end of the fitting and install an electrical ring 
	connector with a wire to a fitting on the engine between the two nuts.&nbsp; </p>

	<h3>
	Damage to the cable and the enclosed wire</h3>
	<p>
	Miniplane does little/nothing to protect various parts of the paramotor from normal wear and tear.&nbsp; This includes the throttle cable.</p>
	<p>With normal use, the cable will rub on various parts of the frame.&nbsp; If the cable has not been protected at these contact points by wrapping it with electrical tape or a piece of split 
	hose, the kill switch wire can short to ground.&nbsp; This will cause an engine shutdown at unexpected times.&nbsp; In extreme cases, the cable itself can wear through to the inner wire and the 
	throttle can jam or cease to function</p>
	<p>Carefully examine the entire length of the cable for damage.&nbsp; Apply tape or hose to those areas where the cable rubs any part of the frame.</p>
	<h2>How to fix the kill switch wire</h2>
	<p>Items needed:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>3/4" heat shrinkable tubing (HST) for newer models that have the new style kill switch. (available from Harbor Freight)</li>
		<li>#18 gauge hook-up wire</li>
		<li>soldering kit or "red" butt connectors and a tool to crimp them&nbsp; Note: the connectors from Harbor Freight are garbage.&nbsp; Get good ones from Home Depot or Lowes.</li>
		<li>right angle pick tool (available from Harbor Freight)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To easily tell what is wrong, separate the connector where 
	the wire enters the throttle cable at the carburetor end.&nbsp; With the 
	engine running at idle, touch the connector that goes into the ignition coil 
	to a ground point on the engine.&nbsp; If the engine stops, you know your 
	kill switch circuit has a problem.&nbsp; You can use a short test lead to do 
	this.&nbsp; At this point, you must disassemble the cable.&nbsp; It requires 
	quite a few tools and some #18 wire (available from auto parts stores or Harbor Freight).&nbsp; If you not know how to solder, you will need some "red" butt connectors and a crimping tool 
	(available from Harbor Freight).&nbsp; Or, you can send it to us and, for $75 + shipping, we will replace the wire so it works 
	like new.</p>
	<p>Because there may be multiple breaks (!), I recommend that the entire wire be replaced.<br><br>This is the kill switch wire from a Miniplane with less 
	than (10) hours on it.&nbsp; We could feel the break in the wire, which was 
	about a foot from the throttle.&nbsp; We sliced the insulation open and 
	exposed the broken ends which, for a time, worked until they separated only 
	a tiny bit.</p>
	<p>If you do not replace the entire wire, carefully check the full length of the wire for breaks.&nbsp; Where there is a break, the wire will easily bend sharply.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="kill switch problems and repair" src="DSCN1010_01.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
	<p>Remove the shrink wrap from the connectors and 
	separate the ends (see the photo below).&nbsp; This is where the kill switch wire goes into the 
	wire loom covering the throttle cable.&nbsp; If you are handy with a digital 
	voltmeter you can find out if you have a break in the kill switch wiring or if it is a problem with the button switch.&nbsp; 
	The wire going into the cable should connect to ground when the kill switch 
	button is pressed.&nbsp; In order to repair/replace the wire you will have 
	to remove the compression ring that holds the wire loom to the end of the 
	Bowden cable fittings.&nbsp; In order to repair/replace the wire, 
	remove the ring at the carburetor end.&nbsp; The rings can be re-used if you are careful.&nbsp; If they do break, you can 
	go to a bike shop and have them apply new ones.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="kill switch problems and repair" src="DSCN1006_01.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
	<p>We stripped 
	the bad ends back a bit, slipped on a piece of shrink-wrap, soldered the 
	ends together, and then slid the shrink wrap over the joint and applied hot 
	air from a heat gun.</p>

	<p>

	<h2>The 
	compression ring</h2>
	<p>
You can insert a right angle pick (available from Harbor Freight) into the small 
	hole where the ring is compressed.&nbsp; Using a pair of pliers, you can 
	force the pick into the hole and it will spread the compression area just 
	enough to remove it.&nbsp; Be sure to force the end of the pick into 
	both sides of the ring.&nbsp; To re-affix it, just squeeze the ring tight 
	with a pair of wire cutters.&nbsp; Do not squeeze too hard or you will cut 
	right through the ring material.&nbsp; You can re-use the compression ring 
	repeatedly if you are very careful not to stretch/squeeze it excessively.&nbsp; 
	Alternatively, you can purchase the special tool which clamps down the ring 
	but this is the only way I know to release a ring for re-use.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="kill switch problems and repair" src="DSCN1024_01.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
	<p>The small piece of vinyl tubing that holds the other wire from the 
	switch to the fitting on the Bowden cable is visible in this photo.&nbsp; The other wire from the kill switch must be firmly connected here or the kill switch will not function.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="kill switch problems and repair" src="DSCN1013_01.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
	<p>
	Use a digital voltmeter to check the kill switch circuit after you have made any repairs.&nbsp; Reassemble everything, including the shrink wrap which holds the kill switch in place on newer 
	models.</p>
