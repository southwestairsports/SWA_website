	<h1>Clutch</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>The Top 80 clutch is a simple centrifugal clutch.&nbsp; As the engine speeds up, the centrifugal force is enough to overcome the force of the springs which hold the shoes (connected to the engine 
	crankshaft) away 
	from the bell (connected to the redrive gears and the propeller).&nbsp; The faster the engine speed, the greater the force of the shoes against the bell.</p>
	<p>Over the years, Miniplane has manufactured different clutches for the Top 80.&nbsp; At present, only a few parts (springs and links) are available for the latest clutch model.&nbsp; The clutch should look like this.&nbsp; This is the side away from the engine.</p>
	<p><img alt="Top 80 clutch assembly" height="480" src="DSCN4070_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>A clutch in good condition should engage at approximately 2,500 RPM.&nbsp; If it engages at a higher RPM, that is not a problem.</p>
	<p>See the <a href="../specsTop80.htm">SPECIFICATIONS page</a> for the proper maintenance intervals for the clutch.</p>
	<h2>Clutch failure</h2>
	<p>Typically, what wears out first in the clutch are the link clips and the removable plates underneath the clips.&nbsp; These are replaceable.&nbsp; The links themselves are hardened tempered 
	steel and virtually never wear out.&nbsp; The clips and plates, on the other hand, are ordinary steel and can wear out.&nbsp; However, the links must be purchased as a complete matched set.&nbsp; 
	The individual parts of the link are not available.</p>
	<p>The next part to wear out are the link holes in the inner hub of the clutch.&nbsp; They will begin to undergo 
	elongation towards the edge of the hub.&nbsp; A failure of one the link holes will not affect the function of the clutch other than increase engine vibration.&nbsp; If (2) adjacent link holes in 
	the inner hub fail, the clutch will vibrate intensely as if a piece of the propeller had been broken off on one side.</p>
	<p>The clutch shoes rarely wear out.</p>
	<p>The clutch bell has a minimum thickness which should be checked every 100 hours or so.&nbsp; Like the shoes, it rarely -- if ever -- will wear out.&nbsp; 
	However, a problem with the clutch shoes could cause the bell to wear out quickly which is why the redrive should be removed and the clutch examined often.</p>
	<h2>Clutch drag at idle</h2>
	<p>If the clutch drags at idle (&lt; 2,200 RPM)it can have various causes.</p>
	<blockquote>1. <span class="bold">Misaligned redrive</span>&nbsp;-- The most common cause is a wearing away of the redrive housing where it attaches to the engine or, usually, the wearing away of the 
		reductor or spacer ring.&nbsp; Either of these problems will allow the redrive and engine shafts to be off center.&nbsp; When off center, the fully retracted shoes will contact the clutch bell and the propeller 
		shaft will turn.&nbsp; If this is not corrected, the clutch inner hub link holes 
	will wear out more quickly requiring a complete replacement of the clutch (the hub is not available separately).&nbsp; The engine will also vibrate more due to the constant flexing of the clutch pads 
		from rotating off center.&nbsp; 
	The special ring must always be installed to help center the clutch on the engine.<br><br>To fix a dragging clutch due to its being off-center, loosen the two nuts that hold the redrive nuts and 
		then just snug them.&nbsp; Start the engine and let it warm up.&nbsp; Adjust the idle so that it is about 3,000 RPM.&nbsp; With a dead-blow hammer, hit the redrive housing in each of the (4) 
		quadrants as shown in <a href="https://youtu.be/URLgT74NXpU">this video</a>.&nbsp; You will see that the propeller will move more when the redrive is hit (moved) in one direction or the other.&nbsp; 
		You will have to experiment to determine the best position of the redrive so that the clutch does not drag.&nbsp; The nuts holding the redrive on must be just tight enough so that the redrive 
		only moves when struck by the dead-blow hammer but will not move from the vibrations of the engine.<br><br>If the propeller turns no matter which way you move the redrive, slow the idle 200 
		RPM and see if the propeller still turns.&nbsp; Repeat the process above.&nbsp; You have to take the time and, if you can, remember which side you struck to align the clutch so that it stopped 
		dragging so you can adjust it next time, as needed.&nbsp; Repeat this process (lowering the idle slightly) until the propeller does not turn.<br><br>Most clutches will not drag at 3,000 RPM.&nbsp; 
		As the clutch wears out, the shoes move out and it will engage at a lower RPM.&nbsp; If it drags at 2,200 RPM or less, rebuild/replace the clutch (see below).<br><br>It might take a few tries to get it aligned correctly.&nbsp; Once you are certain there is no drag, tighten down the nuts to specifications.<br><br>It is annoying that Miniplane does not install pins 
		between the redrive housing and the engine crankcase.&nbsp; This would make absolutely sure that the engine and clutch shafts are perfectly centered.&nbsp; As it is, the alignment can be off 
		many thousandths of an inch.<br><br>2. <span class="bold">Bell clearance</span>&nbsp; The tip of the link on the open side (where the clip is) can extend sufficiently to rub against the clutch bell 
		and drag.&nbsp; To fix this, reverse the links so that the clip side faces the engine.&nbsp; The other side of the link has much less clearance.&nbsp; How did this happen?&nbsp; It was Monday morning after a wild 
		weekend and the worker --somehow -- did not press the clutch bell shaft into the bearings quite far enough.<br><br><img alt="defective Top 80 bell housing" height="480" src="DSCN4066_01.JPG" width="640"><br><br>3. <span class="bold">Springs</span>&nbsp; The springs will weaken over 
	time.&nbsp; If they do not meet <a href="../specsTop80.htm">specifications</a>, they must be replaced.&nbsp; The spring on the left is stretched and must be replaced.&nbsp; A normal spring 
	has no gaps between the coils and is the correct length.</blockquote>
	<blockquote><img alt="Top 80 clutch springs - one good, one bad" height="480" src="DSCN4074_01.JPG" width="640"><br><br>4. <span class="bold">Link holes </span>&nbsp;If the link holes in the either the clutch (less common) or the inner 
	hub (more common) are badly worn, the physics of the clutch change a bit.&nbsp; However, this should not cause the clutch to drag at idle but it may cause the clutch to engage at less than 2,500 
	RPM.</blockquote>
	<blockquote>This inner hub was about to fail.&nbsp; The entire clutch had to be replaced.&nbsp; Notice that the links are not worn at all.&nbsp; Periodic use of anti-seize compound would have 
		prevented the hub from wearing this badly.<br><br>

	<h2>Clutch assembly and repair</h2>
	<p>Aside from these issues, if the clutch is noisy, will not engage, or is always engaged, a new clutch is needed.&nbsp; I have attempted to repair these clutches over the years but without 
	success.&nbsp; In order to service the clutch you will need the special puller that is available from <a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/parts/redrive.htm">Miniplane-USA</a>.&nbsp; It is a very 
	short distance from the drive shaft to the bolt holes and most pullers will not work.</p>
	<p>WARNING - DANGER:&nbsp; DO NOT RUN THE ENGINE WITHOUT THE REDRIVE ATTACHED BECAUSE THE CLUTCH WILL EXPLODE!</p>
	<p>The parts of the clutch</p>
	<p><img alt="Top 80 clutch with parts identified" height="480" src="DSCN4071_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>1. Begin my removing the redrive and securing the clutch so that the nut can be removed.&nbsp; A small oil filter wrench can be used or (much better) a tie down strap can be wrapped around the clutch in the 
	manner below which will keep the clutch from turning while removing/tightening the clutch nut.&nbsp; Using this technique will prevent any damage to the clutch!</p>
	<p><img alt="Top 80 clutch secured with a tie-down strap" height="480" src="DSCN4068_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>2. Liberally apply some WD40 around the nut and let it sit for a few hours so it can penetrate the threads and shaft.&nbsp; Remove the clutch nut.&nbsp; With badly rusted or frozen nuts, you 
	may have to apply heat 
	for about 45 seconds with a propane torch.</p>
	<p>3. Use the correct sized puller to remove the clutch from the tapered engine output shaft.&nbsp; Miniplane-USA has <a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/parts/redrive.htm">this tool here</a> (at 
	the bottom of the page).&nbsp; <span class="italics">Do not even think of removing the clutch using any other method, you will destroy the engine output shaft and/or the clutch.</span> Fit the 
	puller and tighten it slowly.&nbsp; The clutch should just pop off.</p>
	<p>4. Disassemble the clutch.&nbsp; Note carefully the link orientation.&nbsp; The clutch turns counterclockwise facing it when installed on the engine.&nbsp; The leading end of the link must be 
	set in the inner hub hole and NOT in the clutch shoe hole.&nbsp; The open end of the clip must be installed so that it faces the trailing end of the link.</p>
	<blockquote>a.) Remove the clips by sliding them off by squeezing on the open end of the clip and link stud with a pair of pliers.&nbsp; Remove the plates under the clips.<br><br>b.)&nbsp; Place the clutch on a board with the springs facing down 
	(the side that faces the engine being up, as here in the photo).&nbsp; Using a small screwdriver 
	or punch, drive one end of the spring out of the hole in the clutch shoe as shown here.&nbsp; Carefully remove the spring after removing the links.&nbsp; If the springs are stretched or damaged, they cannot be reused.<br>
		<br>In the photo below, the view is of the back side of the clutch (the side facing the engine).<br>
	<br><img alt="Remove the springs on a Top 80 clutch" height="480" src="DSCN4073_01.JPG" width="640"><br><br>c.) Once the clutch shoe tension is released, it is easy to remove the links. 
	</blockquote>
	<p>5. Carefully examine all of the clutch parts for wear, especially the inner hub.&nbsp; Replace parts (or the entire clutch) as needed.</p>
	<p>6. Assembly of the clutch is basically the reverse of step #4 above.&nbsp; The inner hub will only fit on the engine shaft one way.</p>
	<p>Use a small amount of anti-seize compound on the shafts of the links and under the plates to retard wear.&nbsp; Too much of it will get into the clutch shoes and cause them to slip.&nbsp; Every 
	50 hours or so, it is a good idea to disassemble the clutch and re-lubricate the links.</p>
	<p>The shoes can be put on the inner hub with the machined space for the springs facing the engine or facing the redrive.</p>
	<p>The links can be put in on either side just as long as the leading edge of the link is connected to the inner hub.</p>
	<p>If the links are touching the bell, just reverse them so that the clips are on the engine side where there is more clearance.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>The springs are easy to damage so be careful.&nbsp; Hold the clutch in a vise.&nbsp; Install the first spring is relatively easy, but not the second one.&nbsp; Use a small screwdriver to 
	separate the clutch halves just a little (twist the screwdriver 90 degrees to it stays in place) on the side that already has a spring. WARNING: do not use a big screwdriver to do this or you risk 
	overstretching the spring!</p>
	<p><img alt="Top 80 clutch spring installation" height="480" src="DSCN4742_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>Using a small screwdriver, push against the second spring.&nbsp; Use the other hand to help.&nbsp; Move the spring just 
	enough to catch the tip of the spring in the hole.&nbsp; With a screwdriver gently push the spring completely into the hole.</p>
	<p>The clutch shoes are different on each side.&nbsp; One side has a machined out space for the spring.&nbsp; If the spring is put on the wrong side (the non-machined side) there is 
	a sharp corner where the neck of the spring will rub.&nbsp; This can weaken the spring and may cause it to break.&nbsp; This sharp edge is visible in this photo.&nbsp; Miniplane has stated that it 
	does not matter which side of the clutch shoe the spring is installed.&nbsp; The advantage of using the "wrong side" is that it is much easier to install the spring.&nbsp; It probably does not 
	matter if the springs are installed on the "wrong side" but I would not do it....&nbsp; Miniplane does not design the paramotor and all of its parts to last more than about 350 hours.&nbsp; 
	Beyond that, there are annoying but, fortunately, inexpensive bugs that must be repaired.&nbsp; This site documents these defects.<br><br>The engine will probably last 500-750 hours without a major 
	overhaul if properly taken care of.</p>
	<p><img alt="Top 80 clutch with spring on wrong side" height="373" src="DSCN4082%20-%20Copy.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p><span class="bold">Factory oops?</span>&nbsp; Below is a new clutch from the factory showing the back side (the side facing the engine) with the springs put in the wrong side of the shoes.&nbsp; 
	It was easy to fix this problem.&nbsp; What would have happened if the springs were left on the other side?&nbsp; Would the entire clutch wear out before the springs would break?&nbsp; It is 
	difficult to say but why have the risk?&nbsp; Always 
	thoroughly check new parts carefully as they may have assembly errors.</p>
	<p><img alt="Top 80 clutch" height="480" src="DSCN4063_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>The clutch below had to have the links reversed so that they would not rub against the bell housing, causing the propeller to turn at idle.&nbsp; Note also that the machined openings for the 
	springs are on the back side -- and so are the springs.</p>
	<p><img alt="Top 80 clutch with properly installed srpings" height="480" src="DSCN4069_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>6. Install the clutch on the engine shaft and tighten to specifications.</p>
	<p>7. Place the redrive on the engine and snug the nuts.&nbsp; Slowly turn the engine with the starter.&nbsp; If the propeller shaft moves at all, you know that the clutch is dragging.</p>
	<p>This is a design bug.&nbsp; The redrive housing should be centered with pins, not an aluminum ring, as it is on all ATV's and motorcycle engines.&nbsp; If Miniplane had used pins to center the 
	redrive, clutch drag would NOT be an issue.</p>
	<p>With a 
	dead-blow hammer, gently tap the bottom of the redrive housing in the upward direction.&nbsp; Slowly turn the engine again with the starter to see if the propeller shaft moves.&nbsp; If 
	it stops moving, you know that redrive is correctly aligned.&nbsp; If the propeller shaft still moves, trying tapping the redrive housing in a different direction.&nbsp; It make a take a few tries to 
	get it aligned correctly.</p>
	<p>This operation is easier if the engine is running (at idle) but you must be extremely careful!</p>
	<p>&nbsp;Once you are certain there is no drag, tighten down the nuts to specifications.&nbsp; Test run the engine.&nbsp; The propeller should not turn if the engine is running 
	below 2,500 RPM.&nbsp; If it does, you will have to loosen things and readjust the redrive again.</p>
	<h2>Parts source</h2>
	<p>Miniplane-USA has replacement links, springs, and the entire clutch.&nbsp; Note that the photo of the clutch on <a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/parts/redrive.htm">Miniplane-USA's</a> page 
	has only (2) of the (4) links installed.&nbsp; If pilots order a replacement clutch, it will include all (4) links.&nbsp; Parts are not available for the older style clutches.&nbsp; If there are 
	problems, pilots will have to purchase the complete replacement clutch which, for most pilots, is the best option.</p>
