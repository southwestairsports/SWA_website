	<h1>Fuel system leaks</h1>

	<p>by Had Robinson<br></p>
	<p>Air leaks in your fuel system can cause your engine to burn up so they must be fixed.&nbsp; These leaks are not to be confused with <a href="../fueltankleaks/leakytanks.htm">leaks in the fuel 
	tank</a>.&nbsp; The former are leaks in the fuel system piping/filters that allow air to enter the system.&nbsp; Fuel is stored in a tank below the engine.&nbsp; A pump on the carburetor sucks the 
	fuel up and then pumps it into the metering system of the carburetor.&nbsp; If there are any leaks in the piping or filters of the system, the pump will suck air instead of fuel.</p>
	<p>On the other hand, external leaks in the fuel tank are more an annoyance (the oil in the leaked fuel attracts dust/dirt) and these leaks make it more difficult to prime the fuel system.<br></p>
	<p>Do you see large bubbles in 
	the fuel line going into your carburetor?&nbsp; They are most likely vaporized fuel.&nbsp; Gasoline, especially when it is 
	formulated for winter use, has a low boiling point (around 110+ degrees F) 
	and if this grade of fuel is used in summertime, it can turn into fizz 
	inside your fuel lines and carburetor.&nbsp; This condition can cause your 
	engine to stall (a.k.a. "vapor lock").&nbsp; The only solution for this is to 
	fly in cooler weather or use aviation gasoline (AVGAS).</p>
	<h2>Fuel vapor or a leak?</h2>
	<p>Rarely, the bubbles may be caused by a leak somewhere in your fuel supply 
	system.&nbsp; How can you tell if it's vapor or a leak?&nbsp; The easiest way is to 
	pressurize your fuel tank (as when priming the system) while your engine is 
	idling.&nbsp; Connect a flexible tube to the priming pipe on the gas tank.&nbsp; This way, you will be able to observe the fuel system much better.&nbsp; If the bubbles do not disappear after a while, you know 
	that you are looking at vaporized fuel (small bubbles).&nbsp; If the bubbles disappear, you have an air leak.&nbsp; Do NOT use an air 
	hose to pressurize the fuel tank, it could blow up and you would probably make the news....</p>
	<p>If you think you have a leak in your system, be sure the weather is cool 
	so bubbles of fuel vapor are not likely to form.&nbsp; With the engine at 
	idle, look carefully at all the parts of your fuel system from the 
	carburetor to the fuel tank.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you see bubbles coming in to the 
	system at some point, you can do a simple test to determine whether it is 
	a leak or fuel turning into vapor.</p>
	<p>At the point where the bubbles start, smear a wad of Vaseline over the 
	general area.&nbsp; If you still see bubbles, it is just fuel 
	vapor.&nbsp; If the bubbles suddenly stop, you know you have a leak.&nbsp; 
	Vaseline that has been stored in your freezer works the best.</p>
	<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: The fuel filter always has what looks like air in it but it is fuel vapor (OK).&nbsp; This will not affect your engine's performance.</p>
	<p>The Top 80 fuel pump has to suck fuel from the tank below.&nbsp; The lower the fuel level in the tank, the greater the vacuum needed to get the fuel to the engine and the greater the tendency 
	to form vapor bubbles in the lines.&nbsp; Vaporized fuel can vapor lock the fuel system and cause fuel starvation, a potentially serious condition that can ruin an engine.&nbsp; Pilots who use 
	aviation gasoline (AVGAS) will not experience vapor lock.&nbsp; For the details on how to eliminate lead fouling from the use of AVGAS (and the increased maintenance this requires), see our
	<a href="../fueloilspecs/fuelOil.htm">fuel specifications</a> page.</p>
	<h2>Defective fuel filters</h2>
	<p>The source of the
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2OOotOEsG4">leak in this 
	engine</a> was difficult to find as the lines and filter passed a 15 lb./in pressure test.&nbsp; However, when a 10" vacuum was placed on the lines and filter (to simulate the action of the fuel 
	pump), it was easy to see where the air was getting in.</p>
	<p>This Miniplane OEM filter had a leak at the arrow.&nbsp; I am sorry to say the Miniplane's (or their supplier's) QC is poor and they occasionally send out filters that leak.</p>

	<p>TIP: To easily 
	remove the fuel filter from the tubing, heat the tubing with an air gun or a 
	hair dryer until it is almost too hot to touch.&nbsp; The tubing will easily 
	slip right off of the fittings on the fuel filter.&nbsp; Use a slight amount of pure silicone grease and the fittings and tubing to ease installation and prevent the tubing from splitting.</p>
