	<h1>Ignition problems on the Top 80 and how to test</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Generally, the 
	most overlooked ignition problem on the Top 80 is the condition of the spark 
	plug.&nbsp; Pilots should always carry a spare and have the necessary tools 
	on hand to change the spark plug and accurately set the gap.&nbsp; Use a 
	torque wrench to ensure that the plug is not over or under-tightened.</p>
	<p>If the spark plug is not torqued down enough, it will leak and high end 
	engine performance will suffer.&nbsp; Excessive torque can destroy the 
	threads on the cylinder.&nbsp; Pilots should invest in a torque wrench if they 
	plan to service the spark plug.&nbsp; A good torque wrench is available from 
	Harbor Freight for around $10 (in the U.S.).&nbsp; Plugs out of the box may not have the 
	correct gap  – check them before installation.&nbsp; Use a spark plug gauge to 
	set the gap correctly (it uses a gauged wire to check the gap rather than a 
	flat tab).</p>
	<p>The Top 80 does not have a high energy 
	ignition system (e.g. capacitor discharge/computer controlled system) so it 
	is very sensitive to plug, coil, or wire problems.&nbsp; Here are the
	<a href="../sparkplugspecs/sparkplugspecs.htm">proper 
	specifications</a> for the type of spark plug, gap, torque, etc.</p>
	<p>For some 
	introductory information about engine ignition systems, visit
	<a href="http://www.auto-repair-help.com/automotive_maintenance/ignition_overview.php">
	this site</a>.&nbsp; For the curious, here is the <a href="../ignition-coil/coil_002154-1.pdf">specification sheet</a> from IDM (the manufacturer) on the coil used in the Top 80 engine.</p>
	<p>Tools needed: <a href="../../../toolkit/paramotor_essential_toolkit.htm">Digital voltmeter &amp; some test leads</a>.&nbsp; Harbor Freight has these tools for less than $15 US.&nbsp; In the tests below, 
	use a test lead to connect the black lead of the multimeter to the engine ground e.g. a cooling fin on the cylinder.&nbsp; (If you do not know how to measure resistance, Fluke has
	<a href="http://en-us.fluke.com/training/training-library/test-tools/digital-multimeters/how-to-measure-resistance.html">this site</a> for the basic "how-to".)</p>
	<h2 id="Primary_Wire">Primary wire test</h2>
	<p>
The resistance of the primary wire 
	(thin black wire going from the coil to the kill switch circuit) should be 
	about 3 Ohms to ground.&nbsp; However, this value depends on the quality of 
	the digital voltmeter/ohmmeter that you are using and can be off by 10-20%. If the primary 
	wire has zero or infinite resistance to ground, the coil is bad and will 
	have to replaced.&nbsp; Low primary resistance is particularly hard 
	to measure accurately but, thankfully, it is rarely a problem except maybe 
	with a grounded kill switch circuit.</p>
	<h2 id="Secondary_Wire_Information">Secondary wire and coil test</h2>
	<p>The resistance of the secondary wire (the one going to the spark 
	plug) + the coil should be 17K Ohms measured from inside the spark plug cap to 
	the coil itself (ground).&nbsp; The measurement is the combined resistance of the original (non-shortened) secondary wire AND the coil.&nbsp; Note: If you have an early model of the Top 80, the 
	value will be around 8.5K Ohms.</p>
	<p>If the resistance is less than about 15.5K Ohms (or less than 8.5K Ohm on the early models of the Top 80), the coil is bad and you will have to replace everything.&nbsp; The engine may start and run but top end performance will suffer.</p>
	<p>If the secondary wire is open (no resistance to ground), the 
	coil is probably OK.&nbsp; If this is the case, you can <a href="../secondarywirereplacement/sec_repl.htm">replace the wire</a> rather than go to the trouble and expense of replacing the entire 
	coil assembly.</p>
	<p>If you choose to replace the secondary wire, it is first a good idea to find out where the open or break is.&nbsp; To do this, take a sharp sewing needle and gently shove it about 1/2 way through the wire and about 1/2 the 
	way back to the oil.&nbsp; This will make a harmless pinhole in the wire.&nbsp; With the digital ohmmeter, see if there is resistance and how much.&nbsp; If there is resistance, it means that the coil is probably OK.&nbsp; If there is no resistance, 
	move the needle 1/2 way back towards the coil.&nbsp; Continue moving the needle back towards the coil until you have resistance of some value.&nbsp; The actual value will depend how far back you 
	go to the coil.&nbsp; The value can range from about 9K-17K Ohms.&nbsp; If there is no resistance when measured 4" or less from the coil, the technique used to repair the secondary wire will not work 
	as we need a short stub that is good coming out of the coil.&nbsp; (The new repair technique does not require a stub.)</p>
	<h2>Failed Test?</h2>
	<p>Here is a photo of a bad ignition coil from a recent Top 80.&nbsp;&nbsp;The resistance reads 7.7K Ohms from the spark plug boot to the coil ground, less than half of specifications.&nbsp; The coil was new but was incorrectly installed so that 
	the tips of the coil contacted the flywheel.&nbsp; This quickly destroyed the center post and heated up the coil until the internal wire insulation failed and the coil shorted out to ground.&nbsp; 
	Please see the <a href="../specsTop80.htm">specifications</a> page for the resistance of the carbon-core secondary wire used by Miniplane.</p>
	<p>

	<p>Sometimes a small crack or cut in the secondary wire insulation will allow 
	the high voltage to jump to ground rather than be carried to the spark plug.&nbsp; 
	To check for this, remove the spark plug, reconnect it, and hold the base of 
	the plug firmly against the top of the engine.&nbsp; Place the paramotor in 
	a darkened area and pull quickly on the starter while looking at various 
	parts of the coil and secondary wire.&nbsp; There should ONLY be a bright 
	spark across the spark plug gap and nowhere else.<br><br>If pilots want to 
	do a thorough check of the ignition coil, get a used spark plug and set the 
	gap to +0.045" and repeat the above test.&nbsp; The greater gap will insure 
	that the coil has the ability to produce a good enough spark while under 
	load.&nbsp; If there is a good spark, the coil is OK.</p>
	<p>As the load of the engine increases, the density of the fuel/air mix in the cylinder increases.&nbsp; As the density increases, the spark gap breakdown voltage increases.&nbsp; This is why the 
	ignition system must be top condition if full power is to be realized by the engine.&nbsp; Those who are curious about the principles of how the spark plug works in an engine can read this
	<a href="PressureReconstructionSAE.pdf">technical document </a>from the Society of Automotive Engineers.<br><br>Note: Miniplane recommends that pilots never remove the spark plug from the 
	secondary wire and then crank the engine because very high voltages can be created which can destroy the coil if these voltages are not shunted to ground directly through a spark plug or a test 
	lead connected from the metal clip inside the spark plug cap.&nbsp; Always have a spark plug connected and touching ground before cranking the engine.<br><br>The 
	use of a carbon-core instead of copper increases the resistance of the 
	secondary circuit and helps suppress ignition noise in nearby radios caused 
	by the spark.&nbsp; This special kind of high voltage wiring has a 
	resistance of about 3,000 Ohms/ft.&nbsp; The downside is that the core is 
	fragile, will break, and then eventually burn out.&nbsp; The engine will run 
	with a broken core but high end performance deteriorates eventually as the 
	spark weakens.&nbsp; The ignition will eventually fail with time because, as 
	the engine runs, the gap between the broken core ends will widen as the ends 
	burn.&nbsp; That 
	is, the high voltage arc will gradually burn the core ends away from each 
	other increasing the gap until the spark voltage is insufficient to jump 
	across the gap in the core.&nbsp; When this happens a new 
	secondary wire
	can be installed.&nbsp; Replacing the entire coil is much more difficult 
	than replacing/fixing the secondary wire.<br><br>Pilots often notice some 
	soot under the spark plug cap. It is pulverized rubber that is created by 
	the severe vibration of the spark plug chewing away at the inside of the 
	spark plug cap.&nbsp; You can
	replace the secondary wire with an automotive type heavy duty wire and 
	cap and this problem will be much less.</p>
	<h2>Secondary wire temporary field repair</h2>
	<p id="break_is_in_the_secondary_wire">
	A field repair of a bad secondary wire can easily be made if the coil is good.&nbsp; Most of the secondary wire is located far from any metal parts so using high tension replacement wire is 
	unnecessary.<br><br>Use the following procedure to find the 
	break is in the 
	secondary wire (where to repair it) and, at the same time, to check whether the coil is good.&nbsp; It is expensive and difficult to replace the coil and a waste if just the secondary wire is bad.</p>
	<p>
	Connect a fine 
	needle to one of the probes of the ohmmeter and, starting at the spark plug&nbsp; 
	connection, stick the needle into the wire every 1/2" or so, moving back towards 
	the coil.&nbsp; When some resistance is indicated (see specifications), that will be 
	the approximate location of the break in the carbon-core.&nbsp; If zero resistance or less than specifications is found going all of the way back to the high tension post in the coil, the coil is defective and this repair is useless.&nbsp; 
	A new coil must be installed.</p>
	<p>
	The side towards the coil from the last pin location will be 
	useable for the repair.&nbsp; Carefully split open about an 1.5" of the wire 
	at this point with a razor blade to expose about an inch of the end of the 
	broken core that goes to the coil.&nbsp; Pull up about 3/4" of the intact 
	carbon-core.&nbsp; The good part of the core must be lifted out of the 
	insulation.&nbsp; Do NOT pull on the core or it can break.<br><br>Cut a 
	piece of ordinary #18 stranded automotive wire long enough to go from the 
	break to the spark plug cap.&nbsp; Add about an inch or two.&nbsp; Strip the 
	ends about 3/4".&nbsp; Place one stripped end of the new wire in the bottom 
	of the split in the secondary wire.&nbsp; Now, firmly press the carbon-core 
	down on top of it.&nbsp; Carefully hold the split closed so that 
	the new and old wires are firmly touching each other.&nbsp; The core and the 
	wire should overlap each other about 3/4".&nbsp; DO NOT USE ANY SEALANT OR 
	GLUE IN OR ON THE SPLIT!&nbsp; However, for the obsessive types, go to the hardware store and buy a tube of ALNOX brand conductive grease 
	(used by electricians) and coat both wires with it.&nbsp; It will guarantee 
	a good connection between them.&nbsp; Now, close up the split in the 
	secondary wire with electrical tape.&nbsp; Wrap it very tightly.<br><br>
	Drill a hole the same diameter as the new wire in the top of the spark plug 
	cap all the way through.&nbsp; Stick the other end of the new wire in the 
	cap until it sticks out about 1/2" inside.&nbsp; Firmly wrap the new wire to 
	the non-working secondary wire with electrical tape.&nbsp; Reconnect 
	everything.&nbsp; Be sure to firmly push the cap onto the spark plug using a 
	slight twisting motion.&nbsp; This will crush the stranded wire out so that 
	it will firmly touch the top of the spark plug.&nbsp; Now you can seal the 
	hole in the cap with silicone so that the wire does not shake out.&nbsp; DO 
	NOT SEAL ANYTHING ON THE INSIDE OF THE CAP!<br><br>This repair will hold up 
	for about 50 hours of engine time especially if the new wire is 
	firmly wrapped to the old and the spark plug cap is not worn out.&nbsp; The 
	reason the field repair fails is that the new wire going into the top of the 
	spark plug boot gets chewed away by engine vibration.&nbsp; However, a new wire could be 
	spliced to the field repair wire and re-inserted into the cap.</p>
	<p>
	Obsessive-compulsive types could do away with the spark plug boot entirely, solder the new wire to a ring-terminal, and put it under that screw-on terminal.&nbsp; This repair would probably last 
	100's of hours.&nbsp; Anyway, insulated spark plug boots in ultralight aviation serve no purpose except to keep noodle-heads from shocking themselves when the engine is idling and on the ground.&nbsp; 
	Protection from shorting out in the rain?&nbsp; If you fly in the rain -- good luck anyway.&nbsp; The reason for any of this is due to Miniplanes use of lawnmower-quality ignition parts.</p>
	<p>
	The break in this wire occurred right next to the wire 
	anchor on the spark plug side.</p>

	<p class="italics">Note:&nbsp; The Top 80 has severe vibration and you 
	must be careful to anchor the secondary wire at its original locations.&nbsp; 
	Failure to do so will cause premature failure of the secondary wire.</p>
	<h2>Testing the Kill Switch</h2>
	<p>
To test the kill circuit, set things up above 
	per the above (remove the spark plug, reconnect the spark plug, etc.).&nbsp; 
	Push and hold the kill switch while pulling the starter.&nbsp; There should 
	be no spark at the spark plug.&nbsp; Release the switch and pull the 
	starter.&nbsp; A spark at the plug should be seen.</p>
	<h2>Spark plug Problems</h2>
	<p>This 
	is another major source of problems for pilots. Time after time I see spark 
	plugs incorrectly gapped. The 
	ignition systems on paramotors are NOT high energy systems like in a car. 
	Therefore, pilots must be certain that the
	<a href="../sparkplugspecs/sparkplugspecs.htm">plug gap is correct</a> and that the plug is functioning properly.&nbsp; 
	Failure to replace/gap spark plugs is the most common mistake made by 
	pilots.<br><br>Just recently, a experienced pilot was complaining about high end 
	performance on his Top 80. We took the plug out and measured the gap.&nbsp; 
	It was over .030” – way too much.&nbsp; The spark was being quenched under 
	high load (high cylinder pressures) and the engine would stutter badly. The 
	proper gap is .020” - .024” (0.5mm – 0.6mm). The pilot properly gapped his 
	spark plug and the engine ran perfectly – with more power than he had 
	hitherto experienced.<br><br>The severe vibrations of the Top 80 not only destroy the secondary 
	wire after many hours but can also damage the plug itself by 
	breaking internal connections inside.&nbsp; When troubleshooting ignition 
	problems, you should also be sure that the spark plug internal resistance is 
	not more than about 30 Ohms.&nbsp; If it is open (no resistance) change the 
	plug even though the engine may still start.&nbsp; High load performance, 
	however, will suffer.&nbsp; Always use the spark plug specified by 
	Miniplane.&nbsp; They manufactured the engine and know which
	<a href="../sparkplugspecs/sparkplugspecs.htm">spark plug</a> will give you the best performance.</p>
	<h2>Grounding Problems</h2>
	<p>Some paramotors (not the Top 80) may fail to start/run because of ground 
	loops or open grounds. Generally, you want to be certain that the motor and 
	frame are bonded together electrically, e.g., a #14 wire with ring or spade 
	connectors attached at each end which are firmly attached to screws/bolts on 
	the frame and the motor (remove all paint, if necessary, beneath the 
	screw/bolt). If this is not done, connections for grounding the coil and 
	other electrical devices may not work. How the ground is done varies from 
	paramotor to paramotor. The rubber mounts between the motor and frame 
	effectively isolate the two which is why they need to be bonded together 
	with a bonding wire. The resistance from the ignition coil to the aluminum 
	frame of the engine must be less than 1 ohm. When you disconnect the kill 
	switch from the coil, the kill switch circuit must be “open” = no resistance 
	and 1-3 Ohms when the kill button is pushed.</p>
