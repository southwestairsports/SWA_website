	<h1>Cylinder head temperature gauge (including tachometer)</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>A cylinder head temperature gauge (CHT) is an essential tool to monitor the overall health of a 2 stroke engine.&nbsp; An unmodified Top 80 will have a cruising temperature between 120째C - 140째C, 
	depending on ambient conditions and altitude.&nbsp; The maximum is 200째C (390째F) and only for a brief period of less than a minute.&nbsp; Unless you are doing something really stupid, I have yet 
	to see any Top 80 get even close to running the max temperature.&nbsp; Having an engine run too cool (rich) will not do any harm other than foul the spark plug and, to a lesser extent, other parts of the 
	combustion chamber.&nbsp; Running too hot (lean) can quickly destroy an engine.</p>
	<p>As the engine temperature increases to an excessive level, the piston will begin to expand.&nbsp; As the temperature increases even more, the piston will expand enough that its diameter will 
	exceed the inside diameter of the cylinder.&nbsp; At this point, irreversible damage occurs to both the piston and the cylinder.&nbsp; If the temperature increases very quickly, the crown of the 
	piston can melt at the center and form a hole.&nbsp; Thankfully, you will probably only need a new piston.</p>
	<p>This is a piston from an overheated engine.&nbsp; It had seized in the cylinder while running.&nbsp; Note that the lubricating oil on the surface of the piston has burned.&nbsp; Burnt oil 
	cannot lubricate engine parts.&nbsp; If the pilot had had a CHT, an expensive repair could have been avoided.&nbsp; In this case, the overheating was caused by fuel starvation from a clogged 
	fuel inlet filter and a worn out fuel pump.&nbsp; The oil used in this engine was probably some cheap brand because the oil burnt so easily.&nbsp; Fully synthetic oils retain their lubricating 
	properties at much high temperatures and why they should always be used.</p>

	<p>Running the engine hot will destroy the lubricating properties of the oil.&nbsp; Burnt/charred oil can cause the piston ring to bind to the piston lands.&nbsp; In addition, the piston, 
	ring, and cylinder will experience much greater wear.</p>
	<p>Bottom line: a cool running engine will last longer and have fewer problems.&nbsp; While you are at it, you should also install a tachometer/hour meter gauge.</p>
	<h2>1.&nbsp; Parts needed</h2>
	<blockquote>a. TTO Trail Tech Tachometer/Hour Meter<br>b. TTO Trail Tech Temperature Meter (CHT)<br>c. TTO Trail Tech Temp. sensor extension lead (24") part# V300-24<br>d. 4.5mm wide nylon zip ties, 
	black electrical tape</blockquote>
	<p>The gauges and CHT extension are available from <a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/pages/instruments.htm">Miniplane-USA</a>.</p>
	<h2>2.&nbsp; Cooling air duct modification</h2>
	<p>The cooling air duct must be modified in order for the CHT sensor to be mounted underneath the spark plug.&nbsp; The duct must be modified while it is installed on the engine or the cut will 
	not line up with the cooling fins on the cylinder head.&nbsp; There is just enough room between the fins for the sensor to fit.</p>
	<p>Remove the spark plug and cover the hole in the cylinder with a piece of masking tape.&nbsp; You do NOT want debris falling into the cylinder!&nbsp; Using a Dremel tool or a round file, make a 
	cut in the duct by the spark plug 3/8" long and a width of the space between the fins, as shown in the photo.&nbsp; The cut is in line with the spark plug hole and perpendicular to the two duct 
	mounting points.</p>

	<h2>3.&nbsp; Mount the gauges</h2>
	<p>Nylon zip ties should be used to mount the gauges on the left side bar.&nbsp; Quality zip ties should be used (not from China).&nbsp; Go to the electrical department at your hardware store and 
	purchase professional ties used by electricians.&nbsp; The ties will have to have their edges shaved off a bit to fit in the holes of the gauges.&nbsp; It is unwise to drill holes in the side bar in order to mount the gauges because it could be weakened.&nbsp; A 
	failure of the side bar while flying might be catastrophic.</p>
	<p>The holes in the gauges are slightly less than the width of the ties.&nbsp; The 4.5mm ties are stronger and should be used but they must be made a bit narrower with a grinding wheel or a file.</p>
	<p>I have tried many locations, including mounting at the throttle.&nbsp; The location shown here is the best and will result in the least wear and tear on the sensor wires.&nbsp; The gauges are 
	easily visible.&nbsp; Using electrical tape, attach the sensor wires to the side bar every few inches up to the frame attachment point.&nbsp; The stock wire on the CHT is too short so be sure to 
	add the (24)" extension.</p>

	<p><img alt="Top 80 side  bar showing CHT location detail" height="480" src="DSCN4059_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>There must be a loop in the sensor wires (as shown) so they can flex with the up and down movement of the side bar.&nbsp; Stow the extra wire lengths in loops just below the side bar attachment 
	point.&nbsp; The sensor wires are very durable but they cannot be stretched at any time.</p>
	<p>A bag-tie can be used to attach the tachometer sensor to the secondary (spark plug) wire.&nbsp; This is more convenient than a zip tie if the engine must be removed now and then.&nbsp; Note the 
	"X" pattern of the 
	tie over the sensor wire.&nbsp; Optionally, the sensor can be wrapped around the sensor wires (far left green arrow in the photo below) because the gauge electronics are very sensitive and will still pickup the signal 
	from the secondary wire.&nbsp; Because I remove and change out engines so often, I do it this way.</p>

	<p>Remove the stock washer installed on the spark plug (NOT the 2mm spacer washer) and save it (in case you need to run the engine without the CHT connected).</p>
	<p>Re-install the spark plug with the CHT sensor between the spacer and the spark plug.&nbsp; While tightening the spark plug, hold the sensor so it does not touch the air duct at any point.&nbsp; 
	Always use a torque wrench to tighten the spark plug to <a href="../specsTop80.htm">specifications</a>.&nbsp; In general, unless you are professional, use a torque wrench when tightening 
	fasteners.</p>
	<p>The completed installation should look like this.</p>

	<h2>4. Testing</h2>
	<p>Carefully follow the directions included with the gauges.&nbsp; The CHT can be setup with either Fahrenheit or centigrade.&nbsp; I recommend using centigrade because all paramotor engines are 
	manufactured outside the U.S. and the temperatures specified are always given in centigrade.</p>
	<p>Metric vs. the U.S. system -- I love being different than the Europeans and all but two other (backward) nations in the world but, sad to say, the metric system is superior to most of how we do 
	it here.&nbsp; My advice to my fellow Americans:&nbsp; move forward....&nbsp; Maybe, some day, we will have 220VAC as our standard household voltage but I am not optimistic.</p>
