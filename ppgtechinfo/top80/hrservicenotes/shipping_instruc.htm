	<h1>Service, repair, and shipping instructions</h1>
	<h2>Do not ship anything to us without prior authorization!</h2>
	<h2>1.Cost</h2>
	<p>Estimates 
	and labor are charged at $95/hour with a (1) hour minimum charge.&nbsp; You must pay for shipping and insurance both ways.</p>
	<p>Note: I travel extensively in order to train pilots, fly in airshows, and develop paragliding sites.&nbsp; I work on equipment when I have the time to do it and I am at the shop.&nbsp; Please be 
	patient.&nbsp; If it is urgent, let me know.&nbsp; I may have to charge extra for rush jobs.&nbsp; Thanks, -Had</p>
	<h2>2. What to send</h2>
	<p>If you are not sure what service your equipment needs or you want me to test fly your equipment, send the entire engine with all accessories.&nbsp; If it is any paramotor other than a Top 80 or 
	Polini, you must send everything, including the frame.</p>
	<p>If the propeller must be sent (and is a single piece), it is better to ship it in a separate box.&nbsp; Be sure to protect the tips from damage during shipment!</p>
	<h2>3. Form to complete</h2>
	<p>Please print, fill out, and enclose this <a href="../../MotorRepairWorkSheet.pdf">information worksheet</a> with your equipment.&nbsp; Do not use pencil.&nbsp; Write neatly and 
	carefully.</p>
	<h2>4. How to pack -- tote container REQUIRED for engines</h2>
	<p>If you are sending an engine, you must purchase a plastic tote from Lowes or Home depot like <a href="http://www.lowes.com/pd_44066-61896-44066___">this one</a> for about $14.&nbsp; However, if 
	you have your ORIGINAL box that your engine was shipped in and it is in good condition, you may ship it in that.&nbsp; Carefully pack your engine for shipment. Remove the spark plug and airbox.&nbsp; Please detach all fuel hoses, the choke, and throttle cables so they are not damaged in shipment.&nbsp; 
	The carburetor and starter are the more fragile parts of the engine and must be carefully padded.</p>
	<p>If we get an engine not shipped in a tote or in the original box, we will buy one for you but it will cost more.</p>
	<p>If you are 
	shipping an entire motor, do not detach the 
	muffler.&nbsp; The muffler helps protect the engine from damage.&nbsp; The equipment should be tightly packed in and surrounded with 1"
	foam board or the equivalent so that it CANNOT MOVE inside the  
	tote.&nbsp; Used carpet and/or padding may also be used to thoroughly wrap things and is easier to use than stiff foam board.&nbsp; If needed, use foam peanuts, empty water bottles to 
	ensure that things will not move inside the tote.&nbsp; A fuel tank can be used as padding if it is 
	protected from puncture damage from a screw or sharp edge.&nbsp; The packed equipment must be able to survive a drop of 3' from any position.&nbsp; Use nylon ties to secure the lid to 
	the container.</p>
	<h2>5. Who to ship it with</h2>
	<p>Send via UPS or FEDEX ground INSURED for full value.&nbsp; We have had equipment destroyed by these shippers, so they must be insured.</p>
	<p>Our address:</p>
	<p>Southwest Airsports, LLC&nbsp;<br>5134 Thornton St.<br>El Paso, TX 79932<br>U.S.A.</p>
	<h2>6. Payment</h2>
	<p>We accept checks, money orders, and credit cards (given over the phone).&nbsp; If payment is made by credit card, please add 3%, the fee charged us by the provider.</p>
	<h2>7. Post service</h2>
	<p>If we are servicing/repairing an entire engine, it will tuned to run at our altitude (4,000' MSL).&nbsp; If you are at a different altitude above sea level, you MUST learn how to
	<a href="walbrowg8/low_speed_adjustment.htm">adjust your carburetor.</a>&nbsp; Humidity, temperature, and altitude ALL affect how the engine runs so all pilots must be familiar with how to do 
	this.</p>
