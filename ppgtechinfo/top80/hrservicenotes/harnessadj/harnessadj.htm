	<h1>Miniplane Harness Adjustment</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>Proper adjustment is necessary for maximum thrust, flying 
	comfort, and ease of launch.</p>
	<p>1. <strong>SUSPEND THE HARNESS</strong>&nbsp; The harness must be suspended from the hang points by some means, the 
	fuel tank filled with fuel, the pilot in full gear including reserve, if 
	used. The harness cannot be adjusted properly unless the weight of the pilot 
	is “all up”. Note: As fuel is used, the harness will tip slightly forward. 
	This is not as important as having the harness/frame horizontal during 
	takeoff when weight is the maximum and the most thrust is required. It is at 
	this time that the maximum climb out rate is needed. Having an assistant is 
	helpful when adjusting the harness.</p>
	<p>2. <strong>ADJUST THE HANG POINTS</strong>&nbsp; While the pilot is sitting in 
	the harness, use a level to adjust the hang points so that the frame is 
	level. This will ensure that the thrust from the propeller is perpendicular 
	to the glider overhead. Loosen the head screws on the collars and then move 
	them as needed. In order to ensure that both sides are equally spaced, 
	measure from the center of the collar (the arrow in the photo) to the hole 
	in the suspension arm where it attaches to the frame. Make sure both collars 
	are the same distance. Note that the suspension arms are shaped differently 
	in order to minimize the torque effects of the paramotor – it is not the 
	result of damage in transit or some other defect. This adjustment is 
	important for getting maximum thrust at takeoff for your Miniplane.</p>

	<p>3. <strong>LEG STRAPS</strong>&nbsp; Adjust the leg straps so that they are comfortable. The leg 
	straps have no other function other than for safety and comfort. If they are 
	too loose, the pilot may have difficulty getting in the harness or sitting 
	after launch (slipping forward). If they are too tight, he may have trouble 
	running in the harness at launch. When the pilot stands up in the harness, 
	there are other straps that keep the harness from getting too low.</p>
	<p>4. <strong>SHOULDER STRAPS</strong>&nbsp; Adjust the shoulder straps so that they are comfortable when the pilot is in the sitting position.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Miiplane harness adjustment" src="DSC00327.JPG" width="448" height="336"></p>
	<p>5. <strong>SEAT STRAPS</strong>&nbsp; Adjust the seat straps so that your legs are at a 
	comfortable angle when sitting in the harness. For long flights it is 
	recommended that a footrest strap be installed. It will prevent the 
	uncomfortable sensation of having your legs hanging from the edge of a chair 
	for long periods. Free flight harnesses do not have this problem because the 
	pilot sits so much further back in the harness. The short seat on the 
	Miniplane is necessary for the launch run. If it were longer, the pilot’s 
	legs would be hindered while running.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Miiplane harness adjustment" src="DSC00331.JPG" width="448" height="336"></p>
	<p>6. <strong>SECONDARY SHOULDER STRAPS</strong>&nbsp; While standing up, tighten the secondary shoulder straps indicated in the 
	photo below to make the harness/frame high enough so that the pilot can 
	comfortably run while launching.&nbsp; If the primary shoulder straps (step #4) are too loose, there 
	will be problems getting this adjustment correct.&nbsp; The tighter they are, the higher the harness/frame is on 
	the pilot’s back while launching.&nbsp; If these straps are adjusted too loose, the lower part of the frame will tend to hit the back of the pilot's legs when launching.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, the tighter they are on some harness models, the greater 
	the risk of breaking the buckles where it connects to the frame if you have a hard landing.&nbsp; Some newer models have a different connection to the frame which is not as prone to breakage.&nbsp; 
	If you have an older model, go to <a href="../harnessrepair/harness_repair.htm">this page</a> to see different ways to get around and permanently fix this problem.</p>
	<p>

	<p>7. <strong>CHEST STRAPS</strong>&nbsp; There are two chest 
	straps. The main chest strap (the lower of the two) must be tightened just 
	enough to keep the suspension bars from separating around the circular 
	contact point with the frame. In other words, there should be no space 
	around the circular plastic disk indicated by the arrow in the photo below.&nbsp; This strap is primarily a safety strap.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Miiplane harness adjustment" src="DSC00332.JPG" width="448" height="336"></p>
	<p>If this strap is too tight or too loose, it will strain the contact 
	point between the bar and the frame. While sitting in the suspended harness, 
	loosen or tighten the main chest strap so that the circular contact points 
	on the bars are flush with the circular contact points on the frame. This 
	adjustment will also affect the spacing between the hang points which will, 
	in turn, affect the safe handling of the glider.</p>
	<p>the upper chest strap is 
	used to help prevent the shoulder straps from slipping off the pilot.</p>
	<p>

	<p><strong>FINAL CHECK</strong>&nbsp; Sit in the harness and 
	check all adjustments. Some of these adjustments, such as the seat angle, 
	can be made while flying when safely away from the ground.&nbsp; Comfort is 
	the most important consideration when adjusting the harness.&nbsp; An uncomfortable harness is a distraction and is a safety issue as a result.</p>
