	<h1>Performance issues with paramotors</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p><span class="italics">"HELP! My engine won't start!"&nbsp; or "My engine runs poorly!</span></p>
	<p>If this is what you are thinking or experiencing, you have come to some helpful pages.&nbsp; Below are the most common issues I have found that cause problems in paramotors.&nbsp; When looking 
	through the information below, pilots should also reference the respective <a href="../../../ppgtechinfo.htm">specifications page</a> for additional data for their motor.&nbsp; (Even though these 
	pages are specific for the listed motors, 
	the information is largely the same for other paramotors, as well.)&nbsp; It is always a good idea to do all of the tests as, 
	often enough, there can be more than one issue that is causing problems.&nbsp; (Note: Pilots must be cautious when using gasoline containing ethanol.&nbsp; Please follow these
	<a href="../fueloilspecs/fuelOil.htm#Recommendations">recommendations</a>.)&nbsp; Before performing these easy tests be sure that the low speed 
	adjustments on the carburetor have been done correctly. Here are the links for the <a href="../walbrowg8/low_speed_adjustment.htm">WG-8</a> and <a href="../../../wb37/wb37.htm">WB-37</a>.</p>
	<h2 id="Fuel_starvation0">A. Fuel issues</h2>
	<p>It is assumed that you are using the correct fuel and oil at the right ratio.&nbsp; <a href="../fueloilspecs/fuelOil.htm">Check this first</a> if there is any doubt.&nbsp; These tests will ONLY 
	work for diaphragm type carburetors.&nbsp; If you have a Bing carburetor, you are out of luck and will have to send the engine to us or take it to a competent mechanic (rare these days).</p>
	<p>Fuel starvation is the #1 most common problem that I see in the motors coming in here.&nbsp; It leans out the engine and can destroy it due to overheating.&nbsp; Symptoms of fuel starvation can be 
	rough idle, fast idle, no idle, and decreased power output including fading at full throttle.&nbsp; Damage can include stuck piston rings, scuffed cylinder walls, low compression, and actual holes in the top of the piston.</p>
	<h3>Quick fuel system tests</h3>
	<p>To see if fuel is able to pass through all of the tubes, filters, and valves of the engine:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Remove the airbox.</li>
		<li>Tip the engine so that the throat of the carburetor is lower than where it 
	attaches to the engine so that fuel will run OUT of the carburetor and not IN to the engine.&nbsp; Some engines, like the Minari, cannot be tipped to prevent possible flooding.&nbsp; In this case, 
	hold the throttle wide open with a piece of tape or string.&nbsp; This will help fuel that runs into the engine to evaporate quickly.</li>
		<li>Pressurize the fuel tank and hold it with the tip of your tongue.</li>
		<li>Press down 
	and hold the primer lever on the carburetor.&nbsp; (With the Minari, only hold the primer lever just long enough to see if a fuel begins to dribble out of the hole(s) in the carburetor and down 
	into the engine.)</li>
		<li>Fuel should dribble in a steady stream out of the carburetor.&nbsp; For the Minari, leave the throttle wide open for another 10 or 20 minutes so that the excess fuel can 
	evaporate.</ol>
	If this test fails, remove the fuel line going into the carburetor and 
	pressurize the fuel tank.&nbsp; If fuel comes spurting out of the fuel line, you know something in the carburetor is stopping the flow of fuel, probably a clogged fuel inlet screen.&nbsp; A 
	rebuild of the carburetor will be necessary.&nbsp; If no fuel comes out of the fuel line you probably have a clogged tank or inline filter or a crushed fuel line.
	
	<p>Only perform this next test on the fuel pump if the preceding test passes.</p>
	<p>To test the fuel pump:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Remove the spark plug then reconnect the spark plug to the secondary wire and lay the plug down in the area of the spark plug hole so that the 
	end of the spark plug touches a metal part of the engine.&nbsp; (This grounds the spark plug which MUST be done.)</li>
		<li>Remove the airbox, if it is not already removed.</li>
		<li>Tilt the engine to the right 
	(the carburetor side) about 40 degrees.&nbsp; With the Minari, see the notes in the preceding test.</li>
		<li>Push down on the primer lever.</li>
		<li>Crank the engine.&nbsp; Fuel should dribble out of the carburetor throat and through the black air 
	filter, if the engine has one.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>For the Top 80 ONLY: If this test fails and the carburetor has been recently rebuilt, then it is likely the <a href="../reedvalve/ReedValve.htm">reed valve</a> body is loose and 
	leaking.&nbsp; This often happens ONLY when the engine heats up to normal operating temperature so this MUST be checked.&nbsp; The pump will not work if the passageways to the crankcase are not tight and clear of obstructions.&nbsp; If the carburetor gasket is put on backwards or upside down, the fuel pump 
	will not work even though the engine MAY run, though poorly.</p>
	<p>For all other engines: If this test fails, remove the hose from the crankcase to the fuel pump at the fuel pump end and crank the engine again.&nbsp; You should feel a "whoosh" "whoosh" of air 
	going in and out of the hose as the engine is cranked.&nbsp; There will be a few pounds of pressure in the hose as the engine turns over.&nbsp; If this test fails, something is blocking the flow 
	of the air pulses from the crankcase that work the fuel pump.&nbsp; It could be something in the hose or the fitting that screws into the crankcase is clogged.&nbsp; If the test passes, then the 
	carburetor fuel pump is not working.&nbsp; It could be debris in the pump valves, a bad diaphragm, or a clogged inlet filter screen.&nbsp; In any case, the carburetor will have to removed, 
	disassembled, and thoroughly inspected.&nbsp; If there is any doubts per the conditions of the metering lever and fuel pump diaphragms, rebuild the carburetor.&nbsp; Pilots need to look carefully 
	at the carburetor and see if they can spot the problem.</p>
	<p>If there is any doubt about the performance of the fuel pump, perform a <a href="../fuelsystemtest.htm">thorough test</a> of the fuel system.</p>
	<p>If these tests pass, the fuel system is probably OK and you can go to section "B" 
	below and do the simple ignition test.</p>
	<p>If there is a lot of dirt in the fuel system, the low speed needle valve may be clogged, a 
	rare event.&nbsp; Remove the needle and blow out the disassembled carburetor with compressed air.</p>
	<h3>Thorough fuel system test</h3>
	<p>If fuel does not dribble in a stream out of the carburetor in the tests above, perform this more thorough <a href="../fuelsystemtest.htm">test of the fuel system</a> and fix the problem.&nbsp; If it has been a year or more since the last rebuild, it is time to <a href="../walbrowg8/tuneup/tuneup.htm">rebuild the carburetor</a> 
	regardless if there are problems with performance.</p>
	<h3>Fading near/at full load in the Top 80</h3>
	<p>Fading at full load can be caused 
	by a loose <a href="../reedvalve/ReedValve.htm">reed valve</a> body in the Top 80, an overlooked problem that must be checked in motors that have problems.&nbsp; Most paramotor engines do 
	not port the crankcase pressure changes to the fuel pump through passageways in the carburetor and reed valve but do it directly through a fitting on the crankcase and a tube going directly to the fuel 
	pump diaphragm.&nbsp; Fading at full load may also caused by mechanical and 
	ignition issues in the Top 80 and other engines -- see below.</p>
	<h2>B. Ignition Failure</h2>
	<p>The #2 most common problem is a failure of the ignition system.&nbsp; Thankfully, the only symptom of ignition failure is poor engine output, not overheating which can quickly destroy an engine.</p>
	<h3>Simple ignition system test</h3>
	<p>With a digital multimeter (&lt;$10 from Harbor Freight), measure the resistance from the metal tab inside the spark plug boot to one of the cooling fins on the engine (ground).&nbsp; It should be 17K Ohms 
	+-10% on the Top 
	80.&nbsp; For other engines, if you have resistance between 7K and 20K, you are probably OK.&nbsp; However, if it is 
	open (no resistance), you have a bad secondary wire which must be fixed.&nbsp; Your options are limited to <a href="../secondarywirereplacement/sec_repl.htm">replacing the wire</a> (fairly easy) or
	<a href="../ignition-coil/ignition-coil.htm">replacing the coil</a> (a difficult and expensive operation).&nbsp; An internal break in the secondary wire will cause missing and a drop in engine output at high engine loading 
	and becomes more acute as the engine heats up and internal pressures increase.&nbsp; When 
	the break gets sufficiently wide, the spark cannot jump the gap in the wire, the engine will not start, and, as likely as not, the coil will be destroyed from internal overvoltage.&nbsp; Here are
	<a href="../troubleshooting/elecltroubleshooting.htm#break_is_in_the_secondary_wire">more details</a> on testing the secondary ignition wire.</p>
	<p>If the preceding test is good, place the paramotor out of bright sunlight.&nbsp; Remove the spark plug.&nbsp; Reconnect the secondary wire to the plug and firmly push the metal base of the spark plug against any metal part 
	of the engine, like the exhaust pipe.&nbsp; Pilots who are nervous (me) about getting a shock can use masking tape to FIRMLY hold the plug in place.&nbsp; THE SPARK PLUG MUST BE GROUNDED OR THE 
	IGNITION COIL CAN BE DESTROYED!&nbsp; Pull the starter as if starting the motor.&nbsp; You should see a bright spark at the end of the plug every time the motor makes a complete revolution.</p>
	<p>If both of the above tests are OK, continue with the next section.&nbsp; If not, perform a more detailed <a href="../troubleshooting/elecltroubleshooting.htm">ignition system test</a>.&nbsp; It is fairly easy to do and requires minimal tools.&nbsp; Engines will never reach full output if there are problems with the spark plug and secondary wire.&nbsp; Too great a coil gap will make the engine hard to start.&nbsp; 
	Do not waste your time tinkering with the carburetor if the ignition system is not working properly.</p>
	<h3>Spark plug</h3>
	<p>The #3 issue I see is problems with the spark plug.&nbsp; It must be torqued properly and the gap set to the specifications for your motor.&nbsp; An under-torqued plug will leak, 
	maybe overheat the engine, and the high end performance of the engine will suffer.&nbsp; On the other hand, over-torqueing can destroy the cylinder head.&nbsp; If the gap is too great, the spark will be quenched at high loads, the engine will misfire, and power will drop. &nbsp; Always be certain that the aluminum washer-spacer is installed with the spark plug.&nbsp; If there is any doubt about the condition of the spark plug, replace it.</p>
	

	<h2>C. Mechanical issues</h2>
	<p>Mechanical issues are not as common as issues "A" and "B" above.</p>
	<p>Note: few shops have the tools or knowhow to perform mechanical repairs on paramotors, especially adjusting the timing or replacing the coil on the Top 80.&nbsp; Those who service racing two stroke engines, like dirt bikes and go-karts, are the best bet.&nbsp; For example, it takes about $300 of special tools to service 
	every part of the Top 80 correctly.&nbsp; Thankfully, most pilots will only need a <a href="../../../toolkit/paramotor_essential_toolkit.htm">modest tool set</a> that costs much less.</p>
	<h3>Poor idle</h3>
	<p>Poor idle can be caused by <a href="../clutch/clutch.htm">clutch drag</a>.&nbsp; You cannot adjust the idle correctly unless the clutch does not drag.</p>
	<h3>Loose cylinder head</h3>
	<p>Sometimes, the factory or pilots fail to properly torque down the cylinder head.&nbsp; Remove the cooling air duct/shroud to access the cylinder head nuts to check that they are torqued to 9 Nm 
	(Top 80).&nbsp; For other engines, see their respective specifications on this web site.&nbsp; Tighten loose nuts in a cross-pattern to 4 Nm and then to 9 Nm or the final value for your respective 
	engine.</p>
	<h3>Leaks</h3>
	<p>Check the space between the head and the cylinder for any leaks.&nbsp; The presence of leaks indicates that the head gasket is faulty and should be replaced.&nbsp; NEVER REUSE A HEAD GASKET!&nbsp; 
	I am still amazed at how some DIY's mangle simple things like a head gasket.&nbsp; Don't be an idiot: if you are going to service your own engine, get the necessary parts to do it right.&nbsp; 
	Engine leaks are common.&nbsp; Note that a leak can originate at one point on the engine and air passing rapidly over the engine can move it around.</p>
	<p>If you think you have a leak, FIRST thoroughly CLEAN the engine THEN run it an hour and see if you can pinpoint the leak.&nbsp; If the leak is black and gummy, it is a leak AFTER the fuel/oil 
	mixture is burned.&nbsp; If the oil is clear in color, it is a leak BEFORE the mixture is burned.&nbsp; For example, leaks between the cylinder and crankcase will have oil that is clear in color 
	because it has not been burned yet.</p>
	<h3>Compression</h3>
	<p>Verify engine <a href="../specsTop80.htm">compression</a>.&nbsp; If this test fails, you are hosed....</p>
	<h3>Carburetor gasket in the Top 80</h3>
	<p>Sometimes, the gasket between the reed valve assembly and the carburetor will be installed incorrectly.&nbsp; The small hole in the gasket which transmits the pulses from the crankcase must 
	line up with the holes in the reed valve and the carburetor.&nbsp; This problem will be evident during a thorough test of the fuel system.&nbsp; The engine may run at low speeds but not under 
	load.</p>
	<h3>Timing and coil gap</h3>
	<p>The i<a href="../timing/check_timing.htm">gnition timing</a> and the <a href="../ignition-coil/ignition-coil.htm">coil gap</a> must be correct.&nbsp; Pilots should send their engines to competent mechanics to have these values checked and adjusted if they cannot do it themselves.&nbsp; These 
	are 
	rare conditions that, ordinarily, will not need to be checked.&nbsp; However, incompetent people will go in and change these values -- to their harm.</p>
	<h3>Cooling</h3>
	<p>The cooling system on the Top 80 should be checked to be sure there is nothing clogging the system.&nbsp; The engine below had a slight problem....</p>

	<h2>D. <a href="../walbrowg8/midrange_performance/midrange_performance_problems.htm">Midrange performance issues</a></h2>
	<p>Follow the link for information on this thorny issue.&nbsp; This problem is fixable but most do not bother.&nbsp; Putting up 
	with a bit of roughness in the midrange is not too bad unless you live at high altitudes where this problem can become acute.</p>
