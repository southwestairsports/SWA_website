	<h1>Leaking fuel tank caps and problems priming the fuel system</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>Italian manufacturers have serious troubles with quality control.&nbsp; In this case, Miniplane employees or their suppliers routinely do not properly monitor the temperature and pressure of 
	the molding machines used to make the fuel 
	tanks, caps, and related parts.&nbsp; In addition, they may not finish the rough edges after these parts are molded.&nbsp; In particular, they fail to smooth out the edges of the tanks where they 
	contact the caps and the openings for the various tubes. The result is that 
	the tanks leak not only fuel but they are difficult to pressurize with 
	one's breath.&nbsp; The net result is that pilots have trouble with priming the fuel system.</p>
	<p>There is nothing 
	wrong with the concept of a priming system using a tube to pressurize the 
	fuel tank.&nbsp; A primer bulb, on the other hand, adds weight and is another 
	unnecessary point of failure in your fuel system.&nbsp; In addition, most 
	priming bulbs are not resistant to the effects of ethanol in fuel and will 
	quickly harden, crack, and leak  â€“  just like many other fuel system 
	components. </p>
	<h2>Testing your fuel tank for leaks</h2>
	<p>The best way is to immerse it in 
	water (just the top of the tank) and blow in the primer tube to see where 
	the leaks are. If there are leaks do the following, as appropriate:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Cap Openings:&nbsp; With a wide file, finish the tank openings until 
	they are perfectly flat and smooth.&nbsp; A block of wood (so it's flat) with sandpaper may also be used. </li>
		<li>Caps:&nbsp; Be sure to check inside the caps 
	carefully.&nbsp; I have discovered defects UNDER the cap gasket that caused 
	leaks (see the photo below). </li>
		<li>Tube Openings:&nbsp; With brake cleaner or mineral spirits, 
	thoroughly clean the tube inserts and their openings.&nbsp; Using RTV 
	("blue") from the auto parts store, LIGHTLY coat the inside of openings and 
	the outside of the tubes and insert them into their respective openings. If 
	you use too much RTV it might plug the openings/tubes that need to be clear, 
	like the primer tube.&nbsp; Make sure the primer tube is lined up properly.&nbsp; Let things sit for a day in order to thoroughly cure.  
		</li>
		<li>Retest your tank 
	for leaks. Make sure the primer tube is not restricted or blocked with RTV 
	or bits of tank material.&nbsp; If it is, you can use a length of wire to 
	clear it.</li>
		<li>Another way to discover leaks in the fuel system is to just fly the engine a dozen hours.&nbsp; Dust in the air will stick to the oil mixed in the fuel where the leaks are.&nbsp; There are 
		often multiple leaks in the same tank -- it is so annoying!</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The photo below is of a defective Miniplane fuel tank cap.&nbsp; Pilots would never suspect that the reason their fuel tank is leaking and unable to easily hold priming pressure is because of a molding 
	defect that is UNDER the cap gasket.&nbsp; Their is a sealing ridge in the base of the cap that goes completely around it.&nbsp; The red arrow points to (1) of (3) gaps I found.&nbsp; The other 
	(2) gaps are not as big as this one but will case leaks, just the same.&nbsp; I looked at other Miniplane caps in our shop and they also had this defect, some more, some less in depth.&nbsp; 
	Thankfully, this inexcusable lack of quality control is something we can remedy with relative ease.</p>
	<p>The only fix for this is to smear RTV all over the UNDERSIDE of the cap gasket.&nbsp; You will have to have a very fine pick to lift out the gasket.&nbsp; Do not get RTV on the TOP side of the 
	gasket.&nbsp; If it smears around the cap where it is visible, a shop towel must be quickly used to wipe off the excess.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<span class="italics">It was Monday morning at the Miniplane factory.&nbsp; Giuseppe, the owner's nephew, had a bad headache from the wild party hosted by relatives that weekend.&nbsp; 
		There was all that wine....&nbsp; It was so hard reading and adjusting the numbers on the pressure gauge that is on the plastic molding machine.&nbsp; "Who gives a damn?", 
		he thought.&nbsp; They can't fire me...."</span></blockquote>

	<p>If all is OK, reassemble everything. Without leaks, the tank will easily 
	pressurize and the carburetor&nbsp;will prime correctly.&nbsp; If you want your engine to start the 
	first time, every time, check out this tip on
