	<h1>How to Time the Top 80</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>Timing the Top 80 engine is not an easy task, even with the correct tools.&nbsp; 
	This is because it does not have a 
	movable coil or distributor.&nbsp; As a result, the flywheel has to be 
	clocked relative to the crankshaft.</p>
	<p>If the timing mark on the flywheel 
	is missing, a Sharpie can be used to make a new mark 14mm from 
	the edge of the leading magnet on the flywheel.&nbsp; The timing can be 
	initially set and then checked with this <a href="check_timing.htm">simple 
	and accurate method</a> that uses a timing 
	light and a camshaft timing wheel.&nbsp; The flywheel can then be adjusted 
	accordingly and then the timing checked.&nbsp; It is a time consuming 
	trial and error process.&nbsp; Hopefully, the flywheel has a well defined 
	timing mark.</p>
	<p><img alt="Top 80 flywheel with timing mark indicated" height="480" src="DSCN3883_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>If the timing is too far advanced, 
	the engine will <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_knocking">knock</a> and can destroy the engine.&nbsp; If the timing is 
	too far 
	retarded, the engine will lack power and overheat.&nbsp; Timing must be set 
	properly for the Top 80 to run its best.&nbsp; </p>
	<h2>Special Tools Required</h2>
	<p>1.&nbsp; 
	Top Dead Center Dial Indicator  14mm – This can be made from an old spark plug 
	with the insides removed.&nbsp; 
	<a href="http://www.harborfreight.com/1-inch-travel-machinists-dial-indicator-623.html">Dial indicators</a> are so cheap (in the U.S.) that (5) minute epoxy 
	can be used to set the indicator in the modified spark plug if drilling and tapping a 
	hole for a set screw cannot be done.&nbsp; Alternatively, an
	<a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Innovative-Products-of-America-7880-14mm-Thread-Top-Dead-Center-Indicator-/401063036250?hash=item5d6138455a:g:CgoAAOSwJb9WqxPz">Innovative Products of America 7880 
	14mm Thread Top Dead Center Indicator</a> (eBay) along with a <a href="http://www.harborfreight.com/clamping-dial-indicator-93051.html">clamping dial indicator gauge</a> (Harbor Freight) can be 
	used.&nbsp; But this will cost much more than making the indicator yourself.</p>
	<p>2.&nbsp; Long-reach metric hex bit set – 
	<a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/TEKTON-3-8-in-Drive-SAE-Extra-Long-Hex-Bit-Socket-Set-7-Piece-1362/205671801?cm_mmc=shopping-_-bingpa-_-25-_-205671801&amp;ci_src=328768002&amp;ci_sku=205671801&amp;gclid=CJn34oaE9coCFa3mMgod48IBYQ&amp;gclsrc=ds">Tekton</a> 
	(from Home Depot) makes a set for 
	around $22.&nbsp; If the cheaper Harbor Freight item (#67890) is used, the access holes in 
	the cooling box will have to be drilled out to 5/16" in order to fit the 
	shank of the tool.</p>
	<p>3.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/parts/cooling.htm">Replacement finger screws</a>.&nbsp; Pilots who have modest 
	mechanical skills can also
	<a href="../finger-screw-mod/finger-screw-mod.htm">modify them for reuse</a>.&nbsp; 
	This is recommended for pilots who do their own engine work.&nbsp; It is 
	impossible to correctly torque the finger screws when reinstalling them 
	unless the pawls and springs are removed.&nbsp; The cooling fan spins at 
	over 9,000 RPM and must be properly attached.&nbsp; For a modest charge, send 
	us the used finger screws with the springs and pawls attached as done at the 
	factory (remove the screws carefully with a small end wrench or Vise-Grips) and we 
	will modify the screws so that they can be used repeatedly.&nbsp; Contact us for details.</p>
	<p>4. <a href="http://www.harborfreight.com/bolt-type-wheel-puller-set-62620.html">Wheel puller</a> – you will not be able to safely loosen/remove the flywheel from the crankshaft without using a 
	puller.</p>
	<p>5. Some method to hold the flywheel and the crankshaft such as a small oil filter wrench, a tie down strap, or a homemade tool, such as this:</p>
	<p><img alt="Top 80 homemade tool to hold the flywheel" height="480" src="DSCN4704_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>
	Details of the dial indicator and special holder for attaching it to the 
	cylinder head.&nbsp; The holder was made from a used spark plug.&nbsp; Be sure to shorten the threads on the used spark plug to a 1/2" or so.&nbsp; It will decrease the number of turns you have to 
	screw the tool into the cylinder head. </p>
	<p>
	<img alt="TDC dial indicator made from a used 14mm spark plug" height="480" src="DSCN1865_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<p>1.&nbsp; Remove the engine from the frame.</p>
	<p>2.&nbsp; 
	Remove the starter assembly.&nbsp; To prevent mistakes, take a Sharpie and draw an arrow on both sides of the 
	cylinder indicating the correct rotation of the crankshaft.&nbsp; It is easy 
	to get this backwards (!) when the engine is in pieces.</p>
	<p>3.&nbsp; Remove the redrive and spark 
	plug.</p>
	<p>4.&nbsp; Hold the 
	clutch with a small oil filter wrench or a tie-down strap and remove the flywheel nut.&nbsp; If things are frozen, a Vise-Grip chain wrench with WD-40 should be used to hold the clutch from turning while loosening the nut.&nbsp; Chain wrenches that have teeth will ruin the clutch.&nbsp; Use a wheel puller to loosen the flywheel from the crankshaft.&nbsp; Hold the wheel puller so that the flywheel and puller do not fall off the crankshaft!</p>
	<p><img alt="small oil filter wrench used to hold the clutch on the Top 80" height="480" src="DSCN3867_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>A tie-down strap wrapped around the clutch four or five times, doubled back around one of the redrive studs and stuffed under itself is a secure way to hold and clutch from moving if there is 
	no oil filter wrench available.</p>
	<p><img alt="Top 80 clutch secured with a tie-down strap" height="480" src="DSCN4068_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>5.&nbsp; Carefully put the clutch of the engine in a vice as shown in the 
	photo below.</p>
	<p><img alt="Top 80 engine held in vise by clutch and ready to time" height="480" src="DSCN3884_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>6.&nbsp; Determine TDC with the TDC dial indicator.&nbsp; Set the outer dial to "0" at TDC.&nbsp; Now turn the engine clockwise so that the piston moves down 0.90mm-0.95mm (0.0354"-0.0374") per the dial indicator and wedge the engine at this position that it cannot move.&nbsp; The higher the dial indicator value, the greater the advance of the timing.&nbsp; Hold the engine fast with a wooden wedge at this position.&nbsp; If the cylinder was marked 
	with an arrow indicating the flywheel rotation, the flywheel will be rotating in the <span class="auto-style1">reverse</span> direction.</p>
	<p>Worn engines will have more play in the top end.&nbsp; Note the distance on the flywheel where the piston does not move under the dial indicator.&nbsp; TDC will be between the two points.&nbsp; Or, preferably, turn the flywheel in the direction of the engine rotation and measure TDC just before the dial indicator moves down.&nbsp; It is better to have the timing slightly retarded than slightly advanced on older engines.&nbsp; </p>
	<p><img alt="dial indicator used to determine TDC on an engine" height="480" src="DSCN3850_01.JPG" width="640">&nbsp;</p>
	<p>7.&nbsp; Rotate the flywheel so that the mark (about 14mm from the edge of 
	the leading magnet) is even with the lower coil 
	flange.&nbsp; The nut must be tight enough to hold the flywheel so that it will not be 
	affected by the strong pull of the magnets to the coil.&nbsp; Remove the 
	dial indicator.</p>
	<p><img alt="Top 80 flywheel showing timing mark" height="480" src="DSCN3885_01.JPG" width="640"></p>
	<p>
	8.&nbsp; Tighten the flywheel nut 38-40 Nm.&nbsp; Optional: apply wicking-grade threadlock to the threads after the nut is tightened.&nbsp; A small oil wrench filter wrench, homemade tool (the 
	best option), or a strap can be used to hold the crankshaft while 
	applying torque.&nbsp; Miniplane makes a special tool for this but it is not easily available.&nbsp;
	Be careful while applying torque to the flywheel nut.&nbsp; Any relative movement of the crankshaft and the flywheel will change the timing.</p>
	<p>9.&nbsp; Be sure to <a href="../ignition-coil/ignition-coil.htm">check 
	the coil gap</a>.&nbsp; If it is not correct, the timing and output will be 
	affected.</p>
	<p>10.&nbsp; Check the timing using <a href="check_timing.htm">this method</a> 
	to be sure it was set correctly.</p>
	<p>11.&nbsp; Reassemble the engine and test fly.&nbsp; Test flying the 
	engine will ensure that everything has been done correctly.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>This photo shows the correct way to install the pawl 
	springs before placing the washers on the end of the finger screws and  
	peening the ends.&nbsp; These special screws are expensive and it is a waste 
	to throw them out and is why I developed the 	
	<a href="../finger-screw-mod/finger-screw-mod.htm">modification</a> for reusing them.&nbsp; 
	It is easily done and only requires an inexpensive drill press.&nbsp; Those 
	who do all their own work on the Top 80 should modify the finger screws unless they want to buy new screws every time they service this part of the engine.</p>
