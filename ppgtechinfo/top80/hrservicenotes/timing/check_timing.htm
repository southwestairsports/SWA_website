	<h1>How to Check the Timing on the Top 80</h1>
	<p>This method is the only way to precisely determine the timing of the engine without the need to reference the timing mark on the flywheel.&nbsp; The factory method is 100% mechanical and must 
	rely on a faint mark on the flywheel (which may be missing) and the coil which 
	may have defects or other anomalies from the manufacturing process.&nbsp; The critical step is to be  
	certain that the timing wheel is precisely set to "0" when the piston is at 
	TDC.&nbsp; If the wheel moves, the results of this test will not be 
	accurate.</p>
	<p>Checking the timing is not usually required.&nbsp; If the engine is not performing properly, be sure to first check everything else before checking the timing.</p>
	<h2>Special Tools Required</h2>
	<p>Note: links to sources for these tools may change!</p>
	<p>1.&nbsp; Timing wheel 
	 –  this can be made from a sheet of Plexiglas and this
	<a href="degree-wheel.png">pattern</a>.&nbsp; Alternately, a
	<a href="http://www.jegs.com/i/JEGS-Performance-Products/555/81622/10002/-1?parentProductId=937108">
	camshaft timing wheel</a> may be used.</p>
	<p>2.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.harborfreight.com/xenon-timing-light-3343.html">Ignition Timing light</a> and a 12VDC power source (storage 
	battery). This timing light is from Harbor Freight.&nbsp; The more expensive one (+$10) has a built-in dial to set the advance so the light flashes at TDC.&nbsp; This extra greatly helps set the 
	timing to whatever value you need.</p>
	<p>3.&nbsp; 
	<a href="http://www.harborfreight.com/1-inch-travel-machinists-dial-indicator-623.html">Top Dead Center Dial Indicator</a>  14mm – This can be made from an old spark plug 
	with the insides removed.&nbsp; 
	Dial indicators are so cheap ($10 on sale in the U.S.) that 5 minute epoxy can be used to set the indicator in the adapter if drilling and tapping a hole for a set screw is impractical.&nbsp; Cut off all but 3/8" of the threads on the spark plug.&nbsp; If you do not want to custom make an adapter, get the Laser 2833 Top Dead Centre Indicator which works in conjunction with a dial 
	indicator.&nbsp; Some method to hold the dial indicator on top of the Laser TDC indicator must be used.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp;you CANNOT use the cheap TDC indicators because they are not precise 
	enough.&nbsp; A dial indicator must be used.</p>
	<p>4.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.harborfreight.com/36-inch-low-voltage-test-leads-66712.html">24" test lead with clips at both ends</a></p>
	<p>5.&nbsp; Metal 
	pointer that can be clamped to a cooling fin  –  It can be made out of a 
	thin piece of sheet metal.</p>
	<p>6.&nbsp; A method for turning the 
	crankshaft at about 600 RPM.&nbsp; Any 3/8" electric drill will work along with a <a href="http://www.harborfreight.com/hex-drill-socket-driver-set-3-pc-68513.html">drill to socket adapter</a>.</p>
	<p>7.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/TEKTON-3-8-in-Drive-Metric-Extra-Long-Hex-Bit-Socket-Set-7-Piece-1363/205671802">Long-reach metric hex bit set</a> – Available from Home Depot.&nbsp; If the Harbor Freight item (#67890) is used, the access holes in 
	the cooling box will have to be drilled out to 5/16".</p>
	<p>8.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/parts/cooling.htm">Replacement finger screws</a>.&nbsp; Pilots who have modest 
	mechanical skills can <a href="../finger-screw-mod/finger-screw-mod.htm">modify them for reuse</a>.&nbsp; 
	This is recommended for those who do their own engine work.&nbsp; It is 
	impossible to correctly torque the finger screws when reinstalling them 
	unless the pawls, washers, and springs are removed.&nbsp; The cooling fan spins at 
	over 9,000 RPM and must be properly and securely attached.&nbsp; The incompetent routinely try to re-use these screws and damage their engines as a result.</p>
	<p>9.&nbsp; A method to prevent the crankshaft from turning.&nbsp; A <a href="DSCN3867_01.JPG">small oil filter wrench</a> or, better, a <a href="DSCN4068_01.JPG">tie-down strap</a> will work if the 
	clutch nut has not been over-tightened.&nbsp; If things are frozen, a
	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/IRWIN-Tools-Vise-Grip-9-Inch-Locking/dp/B00004SBCB/ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455377360&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=vise+grip+chain">Vise-Grip chain-wrench</a> must be used to hold the clutch from turning while loosening the nut.&nbsp; Chain wrenches that have teeth will ruin the clutch.&nbsp; 
	If possible, apply copious amounts of WD-40 to the area around the nut the night before.&nbsp; Prior to removing a frozen nut, apply (45) seconds of heat to it from a propane torch.</p>
	<p>10. A <a href="http://www.harborfreight.com/38-in-variable-speed-reversible-drill-60614.html">3/8" electric drill</a>. </p>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<p>1.&nbsp; Remove the engine from the frame.</p>
	<p>2.&nbsp; 
	Remove the starter assembly including the fan and cooling box.&nbsp; To prevent mistakes, take a Sharpie and draw an arrow on both sides of the 
	cylinder indicating the correct rotation of the crankshaft.&nbsp; It is easy 
	to get thinks backwards (!) when the engine is in pieces.</p>
	<p>Be sure to <a href="../ignition-coil/ignition-coil.htm">check the coil 
	gap</a>.&nbsp; If it is not correct, the timing and engine output will be affected.</p>
	<p>3.&nbsp; Remove the 
	redrive and spark 
	plug.</p>
	<p>4.&nbsp; Place the engine in a vice.&nbsp; Do not 
	attempt this procedure without making it secure!</p>
	<p>

	<p>5.&nbsp; Remove the nut on the clutch.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Top 80 engine removing the clutch nut" height="810" src="DSCN1863_01.JPG" width="1080"></p>
	<p>6.&nbsp; Install the timing wheel and pointer on the clutch side.&nbsp; 
	Install the TDC dial indicator.&nbsp; Tighten the 
	clutch nut just enough so that the timing wheel will not rotate 
	relative to the crankshaft.&nbsp; Use the TDC dial indicator to set the piston 
	at TDC (its highest point), adjust the timing wheel 
	to read "0".&nbsp; A mark may be put on the timing wheel at 15° BTDC 
	(or whatever value used) 
	for reference.&nbsp; When running the timing light it makes things much 
	easier to see.</p>

	<p>7.&nbsp; <span class="auto-style1">Remove the TDC dial indicator after setting the timing wheel to TDC!!!!!!!</span>&nbsp; Double-check that the clutch nut is snug.&nbsp; If things get loose, 
	the timing measurement will be incorrect.&nbsp; If the nut is over-tightened, it can crack the timing wheel.</p>
	<p>8.&nbsp; Attach the timing light to a 12V battery.&nbsp; Open the jaws on the sensor cable of the timing light 
	and wrap the test lead 4X or more around the jaws.&nbsp; You have to do this because 
	most timing lights will not be sensitive enough to fire with the low energy 
	ignition system of the Top 80.</p>
	<p>Connect the spark plug to the secondary wire on the engine.&nbsp; Connect one end of the test lead to the grounded 
	tip of the spark plug and the other end to the engine (a cooling fin). DO 
	NOT CRANK THE ENGINE UNLESS THE SECONDARY IS CONNECTED TO A GROUNDED SPARK 
	PLUG!&nbsp; You must have a spark plug connected because the timing light will 
	not work unless there is an actual spark.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="How to Time the Top 80" src="DSCN1867_01.JPG" width="1080" height="810"></p>
	<p>9.&nbsp; <span class="italics">Be certain that you have removed the dial gauge before 
	continuing!</span>&nbsp; Turn the 
	crankshaft in the correct direction at about 600 RPM from the flywheel side.&nbsp; 
	As the RPM is increased from 200 RPM, the timing will advance by about 1.5 
	degrees when 600 RPM is achieved.</p>
	<p>Make a note of the timing value.</p>
	<p>The factory method used to initially set the timing gives a mechanical 
	advance of 14.5° BTDC +/- 0.5°.&nbsp; Pilots who have set the timing to 17° BTDC measured with a timing light 
	have not reported any 
	problems.&nbsp; Even with the timing set correctly, the actual timing will 
	vary, depending on the rotation speed of the flywheel, the condition of the 
	coil and what the coil gap is.&nbsp; Measured values between 14° and 17° 
	degrees should not cause any issues.&nbsp; For every 1° of timing change, the piston moves .004" (0.1mm) and the flywheel .032" (0.8mm).&nbsp; The timing specification has a tolerance of .002" (0.05mm) which is 1/2° +/- range in the timing or 14°-15° BTDC.</p>
	<p>10.&nbsp; Remove the means by which the crankshaft is 
	turned and re-install the 
	TDC dial 
	indicator.&nbsp; Turn the crankshaft with the clutch to TDC.&nbsp; The timing wheel 
	must show TDC (0°).&nbsp; If it does, the timing has been accurately measured.&nbsp; If not, this means the wheel has moved and the 
	process must be repeated starting at step #6.</p>
	<p>11.&nbsp; Reassemble the 
	engine.&nbsp; Always test fly the engine because static tests with 
	paramotors are not accurate because of cavitation of the air around the spinning propeller.&nbsp; That is, the engine will never be under full load unless it is flying in the air.&nbsp; You must 
	be flying along at (21) 
	mph to properly load the engine.</p>
	<p>This photo shows the correct way to install the pawl 
	springs before placing the washers on the end of the finger screws and  
	peening the ends.&nbsp; These special screws are expensive and it is wasteful 
	to throw them out and so I developed a
	<a href="../finger-screw-mod/finger-screw-mod.htm">modification</a> for 
	reusing them.&nbsp; It is easily done and only requires an inexpensive drill 
	press.&nbsp; Those who do all their own work on the Top 80 should modify the 
	finger screws because it is not long before the coil will need replacing or, 
	really, the secondary wire.&nbsp; I have a page that explains
	<a href="../secondarywirereplacement/sec_repl.htm">how to replace the secondary wire</a> 
	with a heavy duty automotive grade wire, if pilots want to minimize the 
	problems associated with replacing the coil.</p>
