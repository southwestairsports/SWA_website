	<h1>Paramotor essential toolkit</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>ALWAYS CHECK THIS LIST FOR UPDATES!</p>
	<p>You have purchased a $6,000 paramotor and you are going to use $10 worth of tools (some screwdrivers and a pair of pump pliers) to work on it.&nbsp; I hope this does not make sense....</p>
	<p>These are the tools that you need to properly service most paramotors including the Top 80.&nbsp; While Harbor Freight does not make professional quality tools, they are more than adequate for 
	the occasional mechanic.&nbsp; Failure to use the proper tools is a guarantee that you will damage your engine.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, there are some who lack basic mechanic-type skills or would 
	rather not work on their engines.&nbsp; In that case, <a href="../../ContactUs/contactus.htm">contact us</a> or a competent local mechanic who knows high performance 2 cycle engines.&nbsp; These are almost always the 
	go-kart or dirt-bike guys and it is worth the effort to find out who they use to service their engines.&nbsp; Shops that specialize in chainsaws will also likely know what they are doing.&nbsp; I 
	do not recommend taking these finely tuned, high performance engines to a small-engine, lawnmower repair shop.</p>
	<p>If you do not know what a torque wrench is or how it works, you will find servicing any engine challenging.&nbsp; Our site can help but you may have to do a web search for the really basic "how to's", 
	e.g., what is a long reach hex bit, etc.</p>
	<p>The&nbsp; tools listed are followed by the <a href="http://www.harborfreight.com/hand-tools.html">Harbor Freight</a> stock number, if they carry it.&nbsp; A few items are only available from auto 
	parts stores or from a specialty tool supplier.&nbsp; The stock numbers, brands, etc. may change over time so pilots may have to do 
	a little extra work to locate the tools listed here.&nbsp; Often enough these tools are on sale at HF, sometimes at 50% or more off.&nbsp; It is easiest to go online and order by stock number.&nbsp; 
	These tools are also available in auto parts stores but you will pay much more for them and they are of the same quality.&nbsp; The basic tool set will allow pilots to work on nearly everything but 
	some parts of the 
	ignition system and the crankshaft.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>When working on engines: "cleanliness is next to godliness."&nbsp; Memorize this phrase if you want to prolong the life of your paramotor.&nbsp; The slobs and the careless will pay for 
		their bad habits.<br></li>
		<li>If you need help on how to use a digital multimeter, Fluke has
	<a href="http://en-us.fluke.com/training/training-library/test-tools/digital-multimeters/how-to-measure-resistance.html">instructions here</a> on how to measure resistance.<br></li>
		<li>Don't be an ignoramus: Use the correct tool for the job.&nbsp; Screwdrivers of all types must fit snugly in the slot(s) of the screw.&nbsp; For flat blade slotted screws, choose a screwdriver with a 
		tip that is the width of the slot and which fits tightly in the slot.&nbsp; For those pilots who do their own carburetor work, it pays to have what the gunsmiths use: a Chapman screwdriver kit 
		model #8900.&nbsp; With precision tools, you will not wreck important parts of your engine.<br>
		</li>
		<li>It is amazing that there are manuals and directions that come with paramotors.&nbsp; STUDY THEM CAREFULLY along with the information on this site.</li>
