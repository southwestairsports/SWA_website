	<h1>PROPELLER Information</h1>
	<h2>1. DUST</h2>
	<p>Dust, dirt, sand, and small rocks sucked through the propeller can 
	often ruin it. When you start and run the engine keep it away from the 
	ground as much as possible.&nbsp; Avoid accelerating until it is on your 
	shoulder. Note that placing the motor on your back is less dangerous than 
	sitting it on the ground.&nbsp; Be careful to counter prop thrust by 
	securely grasping the engine frame and leaning against it.&nbsp; Flying at a 
	beach can quickly damage a wood or carbon fiber propeller.&nbsp; If a pilot 
	must have fun at the beach, he should launch into the wind (!) and apply as 
	little power as possible until well away from the sand.&nbsp; Otherwise, the 
	propeller will be sand blasted.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; It is advisable to attach 
	a good air filter if flying near sand as it is particularly bad for the 
	internals of any engine.</p>
	<h2>2. DANGEROUS USES</h2>
	<p>Resist the temptation to use a paramotor to propel a bicycle or skate 
	board.&nbsp; The bicycle wheels kick up dust and rocks which can reach the 
	propeller and be sucked through it, damaging the propeller. Moreover, engine power is significant 
	and you could have an unpleasant surprise when it's time to stop. (This 
	advice is from Miniplane because -- surprise -- people have used the Top 80 
	in lieu of a scooter.)</p>
	<h2>3. DAMAGED or UNBALANCED PROP</h2>
	<p>Do not fly with the propeller damaged or unbalanced.&nbsp; The 
	blades are subjected to centrifugal forces of close to 2,000 G's. A difference 
	of only 1 gram will cause intense vibrations of 2 kg or more at normal 
	speeds and is sufficient to separate the frame welds or even the tubes. The 
	propeller may be balanced using strips of adhesive tape a few cmâ€™s long or drilling holes in the heavy end. Note: Replacing a damaged propeller costs much less than replacing the redrive and 
	related parts.&nbsp; The studs that attach the redrive to the engine casing have been known to shear under sufficient load.&nbsp; These SS studs should be replaced with tempered steel studs for 
	added strength.</p>
	<h2>4. DAMAGED PAINT ON WOOD PROPELLERS</h2>
	<p>The propeller must not have any cracks and should be 
	inspected often.&nbsp; The paint must be intact over the surface of the 
	propeller otherwise leaking oil can penetrate into the fibers of the wood 
	making subsequent repairs impossible.&nbsp; </p>
	<h2>5. STORAGE OF WOOD PROPELLERS</h2>
	<p>When parked in a vehicle, it is advisable to keep a wood 
	propeller in a horizontal position to prevent moisture near the vehicle 
	floor from warping the blades. A perfectly centered propeller stored 
	vertically can become quickly unbalanced in a hot car. High humidity can 
	cause slight deformations in a new propeller. This can be compensated during 
	the assembly by increasing the torque on the appropriate mounting bolt(s).

	<h2 id="ATTACHING_THE_PROPELLER">6. ATTACHING THE PROPELLER</h2>
	<p>Here are some tips on attaching the propeller, whether carbon fiber or 
	wood.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Miniplane has this <a href="../top80/hrservicenotes/partsdiagrams/redrive.jpg">order for attaching the prop</a>:&nbsp; hub - prop - rubber washer - 
		outer flange.&nbsp; I think this is done to allow the prop some tracking 
		movement relative to the hub.&nbsp; If the washer is placed between the 
		hub and the prop, greater forces caused by out-of-track will be applied 
		to the flange and to the bolts.&nbsp; Severe out-of-track may cause bolt 
		shear no matter which side the washer is placed.&nbsp; Some pilots have 
		reported greater success with the washer between the prop and hub in 
		order to fix tracking errors but Miniplane does not recommend doing it 
		that way.</li>
		<li>Most problems with propeller attachment bolt failure and excessive 
		vibration are 
		due to pilots incorrectly attaching the propeller, damaged propellers 
		and/or hubs, excessive out-of-track and run-out, excessive bolt torque, and propellers with incorrect mounting dimensions.&nbsp; The center hole 
		on the propeller must FIRMLY fit onto the hub projection.&nbsp; It is 
		assumed that the propeller is properly balanced.</li>
		<li>Test for out-of-track alignment (wobble) by manually turning the propeller 
		blade so that each tip passes the same point with a tolerance of 
		less than a millimeter or two.&nbsp; The measurement is parallel with 
		the propeller shaft.&nbsp;
		<a href="http://okigihan.blogspot.com/p/propeller-vibration-although-vibration.html">
		This article</a> has some good tips on minimizing propeller vibration.</li>
		<li>Test for run-out.&nbsp; This measures the distance from the rotating 
		center of the prop to the tips.&nbsp; They must be the same for each tip.&nbsp; This 
		measurement is perpendicular to the propeller shaft.&nbsp; Run-out 
		creates less stress on the paramotor than out-of-track.</li>
		<li>Because the wood of the propeller is elastic, slightly varying 
		the torque of the mounting bolts may correct tracking errors up to 2 mm. Be careful NOT to exceed the maximum torque of the 
		screws (10-13 Nm) when correcting tracking alignment errors.&nbsp; Note: This 
		should not be done with carbon fiber propellers.</li>
		<li>Accelerating the engine while it is on the ground may cause 
		strong vibrations even if the propeller is well balanced and centered. 
		This will lessen after placing the paramotor on your back and taking to 
		the air.&nbsp; There 
		will always be some vibration, including harmonic vibration, caused by the 
		redrive.</li>
		<li>Do NOT over-torque the attachment bolts!&nbsp; The correct torque is 
		10-13 Nm.&nbsp; Slight under-torqueing the bolts will relieve stress 
		caused by out-of-track and, as a result, lessen propeller vibration.&nbsp; 
		If this is done, be certain to use blue threadlock on the bolts and 
		nuts.&nbsp; The worse the out-of-track, the more vibration (stress) that 
		is transmitted to the bolts, hub, shaft, and bearings.&nbsp; The rubber washer is needed to help absorb any vibration caused by the propeller rotating in a different axis than the engine 
		flywheel.</li>
		<li>IMPORTANT!&nbsp; The rubber disk helps isolate the prop from the hub with 
		respect to vibration transmission by allowing some tracking error.&nbsp; 
		The disk goes between the prop and the propeller plate.&nbsp; If it is placed 
		between the prop and the hub, the prop bolts will be under greater 
		stress and may shear and fail but this is unlikely except for the most 
		severe out-of-track.</li>
		<li>Out-of-track and, especially, excessive run-out are difficult to 
		correct on a paramotor.&nbsp; If either is excessive, have a competent 
		mechanic test the hub with a dial micrometer to be certain that it is 
		not the problem.&nbsp; If the hub is OK, pilots may have to replace the 
		propeller.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>7. PROP REPAIRS</h2>
	<p>Minor damage to the propeller can be repaired in 
	minutes by using cyanoacrylate glue (Super Glue) and ordinary baking soda 
	(sodium bicarbonate) as filler.&nbsp; However, a much better product is 
	available called <a href="http://qbond.net/">Q-Bond</a> and is similar to 
	cyanoacrylate glue.&nbsp; It is more expensive than Super Glue but does a 
	better job of repairing dings in a propeller.&nbsp; If you use Super 
	Glue, follow these directions (slightly different for Q-Bond).</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Put a few drops of glue on the surface of the area to be 
		filled</li>
		<li>Sprinkle baking soda over the wet glue.</li>
		<li>Use your fingers to quickly press the baking soda into the 
		glue. (Wear vinyl/latex/nitrile gloves to protect your fingers.)</li>
		<li>Blow off the excess baking soda.</li>
		<li>Repeat the above steps until you achieve the desired 
		thickness.&nbsp; Be sure to soak the baking soda with glue.&nbsp; Let 
		the repair cure for a while.</li>
		<li>Use a flat file to trim the repair.&nbsp; Then use appropriate grades of 
		sandpaper.&nbsp; The goal is to restore the original profile of the propeller.</li>
		<li>Refinish as desired.&nbsp;&nbsp; Using a gray sandable primer 
		and then a finish coat is best.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The surface thus obtained can immediately be painted with nitro type 
	paint (it dries quickly and resists gasoline and oil). Do 
	not use cheap spray paint, e.g. Rustoleum, as it will not render a flat 
	finish and it is very difficult to wet-sand.&nbsp; If nitro paint is not 
	available polyurethane paint can be used.</p>
	<p>If you do not refinish the damaged prop (wood or carbon fiber) immediately, the waste oil from 
	the exhaust will be absorbed by the damaged area and then it will be difficult or 
	impossible to remove it. In this case you may have to clean the prop with a 
	rag soaked in spirits before painting to remove the few traces of oil.&nbsp; 
	Brake cleaner is even better for removing oil/grease.</p>
	<p>The prop can be balanced by varying the thickness of the paint.&nbsp; If 
	it is badly out of balance, holes can be drilled on the heavy end and then 
	sealed with epoxy.&nbsp; Pilots can use balancers made for lawnmower blades 
	which are available in hardware stores for a few dollars.</p>
	<p>For more information you should refer to the manufacturer's propeller, 
	supplied separately.</p>
