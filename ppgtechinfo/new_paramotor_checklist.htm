	<h1>New paramotor assembly guide</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>Purchased a paramotor?&nbsp; Pilots need to be careful that it is ready to operate.&nbsp; Failure to follow the proper steps can ruin an engine.&nbsp; This checklist is primarily for the 
	Miniplane paramotors but the information is general and can be applied to other paramotors.&nbsp; If you have any questions about how to prepare and run your new engine, check with your dealer.</p>
	<p class="auto-style2"><strong>WARNING: PARAMOTORS ARE TWO-STROKE ENGINES AND MUST HAVE OIL MIXED WITH THE FUEL!&nbsp; YOU WILL QUICKLY DESTROY YOUR ENGINE IF YOU DO NOT MIX THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF 
	OIL WITH THE GASOLINE!</strong></p>
	<h2>A. Oil - fuel mix</h2>
	<p>All Miniplane paramotors are two-stroke engines and MUST have oil mixed with the fuel.&nbsp; Here are the mix ratios for the <a href="top80/hrservicenotes/fueloilspecs/fuelOil.htm">various 
	Miniplane engines</a>.</p>
	<h2>B. CHT</h2>
	<p>All pilots should install a 
	<a href="top80/hrservicenotes/CHT/cht.htm">CHT</a> (cylinder head temperature gauge) and tachometer/hour-meter on their engines.&nbsp; The Top 80 with the ABM frame requires the TTO sensor extension #V300-24.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/pages/instruments.htm">Miniplane-USA</a> has these items.&nbsp; A CHT will alert pilots to pending problems with their engines, especially the number #1 killer of all paramotors: overheating.&nbsp; 
	The number #2 killer is failure to mix 2-cycle oil with the fuel, use the correct ratio, or use the correct type of oil.&nbsp; A CHT will not let you know if the fuel has no oil mixed with it -- 
	the damage from overheating happens too quickly.&nbsp; Increasing the oil to fuel ratio does nothing to help extend engine 
	life and may ruin them, as noted by all engine manufacturers.&nbsp; Avoid ethanol fuels. </p>
	<h2>C. Threadlock</h2>
	<p>Miniplane may not apply threadlock to some critical fasteners. The following is for the Top 80 but generally applies to all other Miniplane engines.&nbsp; Make sure that the 
	following have blue threadlock applied:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Engine socket button-head frame mounting bolts</li>
		<li>Exhaust flange studs (use red high strength threadlock instead of blue)</li>
		<li>Muffler socket button-head bolts</li>
		<li>Muffler rubber mount studs</li>
		<li>Screw-on terminal on top of spark plug (use red high strength threadlock instead of blue). Newer sparkplugs may already have this done.</li>
		<li>Reed valve block mounting screws x 2 (Top 80 only) -- A <a href="top80/hrservicenotes/reedvalve/ReedValve.htm">reed valve block leak</a> will cause the fuel pump to fail.&nbsp; The carburetor will have to be removed to do this.</li>
		<li>Check the <a href="ppgtechinfo.htm">specifications page</a> of the listed engines for important information, including torque values.&nbsp; It pays to check the cylinder head nuts for the 
		proper torque (9 Nm) on new or rebuilt Top 80 engines.&nbsp; Other engines do not seem to have this problem.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>D. Assembly</h2>
	<p>1.&nbsp;Assemble the paramotor according to any instructions received.&nbsp; If there are not any, this <a href="https://youtu.be/GbuyrSUpyL0">assembly video</a> for a Miniplane Polini will help.&nbsp; 
	Be sure to install the propeller in the correct position.&nbsp; I recommend doing a <a href="top80/hrservicenotes/compressioncheck.htm">compression check</a> on your new engine and record it in a 
	log.&nbsp; That way, you can periodically evaluate the actual condition of the important mechanical parts of your engine.</p>
	<p>2.&nbsp;If there is a redrive on the motor, be certain that it is filled with the correct type and quantity of oil.&nbsp; If this is not done, the seals on the redrive will be quickly ruined and the gears and bearings will 
	also quickly wear out.&nbsp; 
	Be sure to change the oil after the first (10) hours of use.</p>
	<p>3.&nbsp;There are (2) areas where serious wear occurs during operation.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Miniplane does not provide any protection to these surfaces.</p>
	<blockquote>a. Be sure to wrap black electrical tape around the throttle cable wherever it contacts the engine frame.&nbsp; A piece of split hose can also be used.&nbsp; If you do not do this, the cable will 
	gradually wear away and a.) jam/break the inner throttle cable and/or b.) short the kill switch wire.</blockquote>
	<blockquote>b. If you have the Miniplane ABM frame, the side bars will constantly rub and grind away at the (2) upper side sticks where they screw into the frame.&nbsp; Pilots can wrap the side sticks at the 
	joint with electrical tape or, better, use a piece of <a href="top80/hrservicenotes/sidestickmountprotection/sidestick_mount_protection.htm">automotive heater hose</a> to protect the surfaces.</blockquote>
	<p>4. The side sticks will loosen and come out of their sockets after a dozen or so hours.&nbsp; Take a piece of electrical tape and wrap it around the joint.&nbsp; DO NOT USE THREADLOCK ON THE 
	SIDE STICKS!</p>
	<p>5.&nbsp;Study carefully the section on <a href="top80/hrservicenotes/fueloilspecs/fuelOil.htm">fuel specifications</a>.&nbsp; Fuel should be mixed 
	with oil in small batches only (&lt; 2 gallons at a time).&nbsp; Stored fuel/oil mixes deteriorate rapidly and the lubricating qualities of the oil deteriorate.&nbsp; Remember do NOT store fuel mixed with oil for 
	more than a few weeks, no matter what kind of gasoline is used.</p>
	<p class="auto-style1"></p>
	<p>6.&nbsp;Mix the correct amount of oil with gasoline.&nbsp; Do exactly what the manufacturer of the engine recommends.&nbsp; The best mixing bottle is from <a href="http://www.shoreline-marine.net/">Shoreline Marine</a> 
	and is sold by Sports Academy and others.&nbsp; It is simple, well marked, and can be sealed to keep dirt out.&nbsp; Getting fuel into a Miniplane is difficult without a fuel siphon like 
	<a href="http://safetysiphon.net/siphons/12inch-6ftsiphon.aspx">this one</a>.&nbsp; 
	The Chinese knock-offs available at Harbor Freight do not have the right kind of hoses and will kink and collapse once the siphon is started.&nbsp; The better siphons have a much better quality 
	hose which will last years.&nbsp; Replacement vinyl tubing for fuel siphons can be purchased from most hardware stores.</p>
	<p>7.&nbsp;<a href="top80/hrservicenotes/Starting/starting.htm">Prime the carburetor</a>&nbsp; If this technique is used, the engine will start the first time, every time.&nbsp; If the carburetor does not have a priming lever, use the end of cotton swab that has had the cotton removed.&nbsp; Sticking a metal object into the metering lever diaphragm could injure it.&nbsp; A properly primed engine will 
	rarely need choke except when pilots start their engines while flying and cannot prime them.</p>
	<p>8.&nbsp;Avoid running the engine on the ground unless it is grass or clean concrete.&nbsp; The WORST environment is a beach.&nbsp; SAND RUINS PARAMOTORS!&nbsp; Sand gets sucked into the engine and chews up propellers.&nbsp; Smart pilots will launch from grassy or concrete areas.&nbsp; If you have to launch from the beach, use only enough throttle to get airborne.</p>
	<p>9.&nbsp;After the engine starts, let it idle for a few minutes.&nbsp; The carburetor must be <a href="top80/hrservicenotes/walbrowg8/low_speed_adjustment.htm">adjusted</a> for your particular altitude and environment (humid or dry).</p>
	<p>10.&nbsp;New engines should be <a href="top80/hrservicenotes/engine_breakin.htm">broken-in properly</a> and then only flown for short periods, avoiding full throttle until a full tank of fuel has been consumed.</p>
	<p>11.&nbsp;Test fly the engine.&nbsp; If there are any problems, read <a href="top80/hrservicenotes/performanceissues/performance_issues.htm#Fuel_starvation">this section</a> on performance issues.</p>
	<p>It is unlikely that there are ignition or mechanical problems.&nbsp; The <a href="top80/hrservicenotes/fuelsystemtest.htm">fuel system test</a> is simple.&nbsp; If the pilot does not want to fix the problem, the results of the test will help the dealer or repair shop.&nbsp; If the fuel system 
	does not pass the quick test, contact the dealer.&nbsp; The engine should be returned for a professional evaluation.</p>
	<p>Rarely, Miniplane will have an engine that was assembled incorrectly, even damaged and/or missing sealant in critical places.&nbsp; A professional can find the problem and fix it quickly while an amateur may ruin the engine.</p>
	<p>12.&nbsp; If the engine will be stored for more than a few weeks, <a href="top80/hrservicenotes/purging_the_fuel_system.htm">purge the fuel system</a>.&nbsp; If this is not done, the engine may 
	not start again until the carburetor is rebuilt.&nbsp; In any case, carburetors should be rebuilt yearly.&nbsp; Ethanol fuels attack and destroy fuel system parts as well as mix poorly with 2 
	cycle oils.</p>
