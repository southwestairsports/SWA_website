	<h1>Walbro WB-37 carburetor information</h1>
	<p>The parts kit needed is the K10-WB.</p>
	<p>Rather than a fixed high speed jet like the WG-8, this carburetor has an adjustable high speed jet.&nbsp; It is serviced the same 
	as the <a href="../top80/hrservicenotes/walbrowg8/wg8.htm">WG-8</a> EXCEPT for the high speed adjustment.&nbsp; Be EXTREMELY careful adjusting the high speed system and only follow your paramotor 
	manufacturer's instructions (if any).&nbsp; It is easy to BURN UP 
	your engine!&nbsp; Generally, if you do not have a <a href="../top80/hrservicenotes/CHT/cht.htm">CHT</a> (at the minimum), do not change the high speed adjustment from the factory defaults.</p>
	<p>The Minari has <a href="../Minari/carburetor_adjustment.htm">instructions</a> on how to adjust the WB-37 on the 180cc engine but it is only for that engine and those flying at sea level.&nbsp; 
	If you have another Minari engine or fly at higher altitudes, follow the instruction on this page.</p>
	<h2>Basic carburetor setup</h2>
	<p>Use the steps below to adjust your carburetor if your user manual has no information OR you operate your engine at high altitude.</p>
	<p>BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL THAT THE CYLINDER HEAD TEMPERATURE (CHT) NEVER EXCEEDS 200-220&ordm;C (392-428&ordm;F)!</p>
	<p>It is always safer to run an engine a bit rich (so it runs cooler) than lean (so it runs hotter).&nbsp; 
	There is a 30-60 second lag in the CHT gauge so always throttle up slowly, watching the temperature at all times.&nbsp; It is very easy to quickly overheat an engine by running it lean.&nbsp; If 
	you find that the instructions below result in your engine overheating, simply enrich the high 
	speed mixture.&nbsp; Turn the high speed jet (#1 in the photo below) counter-clockwise 1/8th of a turn then check the temperature.&nbsp; Continue to turn it 1/8th of a turn counter-clockwise until 
	a safe running temperature is achieved.</p>
	<p>1. Open screw #1 (1.5) turns from fully closed as a basic setting.&nbsp; Start the engine and let it warm up.</p>
	<p>2. Turn screw #3 in or out until the idle speed is 1,900 RPM to 2,100 RPM.</p>
	<p>The next step is potentially very dangerous!&nbsp; You must secure the engine to some immovable object like a tree, car hitch, or telephone pole/post.</p>
	<p>3. Go to full throttle and close screw #1 until there is a slight decrease in RPM.&nbsp; The engine is now running in a slightly lean condition at full throttle.</p>
	<p>4. Release the throttle and open screw #1 (3/4) of a turn.&nbsp; This must be done carefully.&nbsp; You do not want the engine to exceed the maximum temperature given above.</p>
	<p>5. With engine idling, open/close screw #2 until maximum speed is obtained.&nbsp; Suddenly apply full throttle.</p>
	<p>If the engine begins to stall, open #2 screw (1/16) of a turn.&nbsp; Suddenly apply full throttle again and see if the engine begins to stall.&nbsp; If it does, open screw #2 another (1/16) of 
	a turn.&nbsp; Continue this step until the engine no longer stalls when full throttle is suddenly applied.</p>
	<p>If the engine does NOT begin to stall, close screw #2&nbsp; (1/16) of a turn.&nbsp; Suddenly apply full throttle.&nbsp; If the engine does not stall, continue to close screw #2 in (1/16) increments 
	until the engine begins to stall when full throttle is applied.&nbsp; If the engine begins to stall, back out the screw (1/16) turn.&nbsp; This is the correct adjustment of the low speed system.</p>
	<p>You may have to re-adjust screw #3 in order to achieve the correct idle speed.&nbsp; In the photo below screw #1 is the high speed jet screw adjustment.&nbsp; #2 is 
	the low speed jet adjustment.&nbsp; #3 is the idle speed adjustment.</p>
