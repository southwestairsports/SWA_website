		A friend sent me this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W86jlvrG54o&amp;feature=share">YouTube</a> video of the young Mr. Kelly. In the video, Kelly recounts the inspiring rescue of him 
		and his brother by a kindhearted Australian woman when they were toddlers (both badly maimed by an IED). Would that all would seek out and assist the orphans in the world who need homes and 
		two parents. (Marilyn and I have done something similar over the years with single women.) Kelly also gives a talented rendition of John Lennon’s “<a href="http://www.lyrics007.com/John%20Lennon%20Lyrics/Imagine%20Lyrics.html">Imagine</a>.”<br><br>
		Lennon was a brilliant musician and composer. Unlike the famous pair Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein, Lennon did not need someone else to write lyrics as he was also a gifted poet who 
		<a href="http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II">captured the worldview</a> 
		of our time: Humanism.<br><br>Worldviews, especially humanism in the West, are so pervasive that they are largely beyond criticism or analysis. Most fail to observe that humanism has been the 
		engine that has driven the bloodiest massacres of all time, including those done in the name of Communism. At its heart, Socialism (whether of the “light” or “heavy” variety) also bears the 
		same creed: We do what’s best for the happiness and peace of society. The differences are just how much and to what extent?<br><br>What Lennon and the other esteemed signers of the Humanist 
		Manifestos have apparently failed to observe is: Who decides what is best and what should be the extent of the measures that are needed to implement it? It is a huge – and yet unanswered – 
		question.<br><br>It is not obvious: Just consider the oceans of blood shed by Stalin, Mao Tse Tung, and the Khmer Rouge. These organizers and their followers made the collective decisions that 
		killed maybe 100 million people all in the name of prosperity, peace, and happiness. It is ironic that they had to murder countless people and still did not reach their goal.<br><br>Lennon 
		pines away that without religion and countries, everything will be wonderful. This is naïve, to say the least. The butcheries done in the name of humanism (or its relatives) dwarf 
		geometrically those who have shamelessly used religion (especially the name of Christ) for their own purposes. The Humanists are quick to condemn “religious” wars but are derelict in 
		connecting the real motives for such.<br><br>As a whole, they and their philosophic relatives have jumped from the frying pan into the fire. The number of Nobel laureates, for example, who 
		have signed these manifestos is amazing. No doubt the signers consider themselves fit to govern the rest of us and are all nice. They think, “What’s wrong with the rest of them? We would be 
		such good leaders!”<br><br>Still, who decides what? They cannot answer this unless it is they themselves who are the decision makers.<br><br>When we sever the cord that binds the human race to 
		any unchangeable moral/ethical truth, we can expect denial and mass confusion. You and I make the rules – whatever they are. But who enforces them? Who decides who the enforcers are? Who 
		decides what measures must be taken by the enforcers against the non-human scum that opposes them? (I use such terms because that is the relative term that describes those who are not 
		Humanists, such as true Christians.) Again, who decides and how is it fixed? Stalin had one way, Gandhi, another. But they both shared the same overall worldview: Godless – and were cousins in 
		the rest of it, especially sharing the notion that no “God” will rescue or interfere in the affairs of Men. <br><br>In sum, Lennon is a hero of this age – but his ideas are not good healthy 
		fare. Instead, they are but warm mush laced with cyanide. In the real world, Lennon and the rest of them get their own way. However, the poor (if they are not murdered in the womb) grow up in 
		fatherless homes because the male gene donor wanted peace and happiness and the female apparently did not give it. It’s a common paradigm and should cause alarm. It’s everywhere – from our 
		local area (the majority of live births in New Mexico are now to single women) to our neighbor to the south. Who are the ones that do the dirty work and the horrific butchery of the narcotics 
		trade turf wars? They are young men, often teenagers, who epitomize “Imagine” – no countries, no religion, no nothing – only Me and what makes Me happy.<br><br>It’s a tragedy that Kelly has 
		bought into it – along with nearly everyone else in the West. But doesn’t it feel good? Martin Luther commented that mankind was like a drunk walking down a corridor with brick walls on both 
		sides, bruised and bloodied from hitting them. Perhaps he should have added: At the end of the corridor is a bottomless chasm.<br><blockquote>
