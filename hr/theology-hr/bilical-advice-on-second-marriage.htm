	<p>by Hadley Robinson</p>
	
	
		<h2>What is Adultery?</h2>
		<p>It is linked to all second and later marriages while the first spouse still lives.&nbsp; Proscribed in the 5th Commandment, adultery is having sexual relations with anyone who is joined to 
		another, unless the spouse of the latter is dead.</p>
		<p>The legal fiction in the Westminster Confession (24:5) that an adulterer is as good as dead (and so releases one party from the marriage per Rom. 7:2) is just as much a fiction as the 
		notion that the State can either make or dissolve a marriage.</p>
		<p>What creates a marriage is what God has done and the corresponding obedience of the couple – not the hubris of any man, especially a representative of the State.&nbsp; Furthermore, the 
		marriage is irrespective of the religious opinions of the parties involved just as loyalty, for example, would be irrelevant to anyone's opinion of it.&nbsp; It is what it is. Marriage is 
		marriage and loyalty is loyalty.</p>
	
	
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>The points made in this essay would, if they are widely implemented in evangelical churches, empty them of about one half of the people because of the presence of those who claim to be 
		genuine Christians but are living in a state of adultery.</p>
		<p>Adultery is widespread and well accepted among the heathen.&nbsp; To our shame, this practice has infiltrated the churches, including church leadership.&nbsp; It took hundreds of years to 
		get to where we are.&nbsp; I cannot think of any other means but violent judgment that can remedy this blight in the Church.&nbsp; Then again, the Bible may be incorrect on how the Creator 
		judges sin in His Church....</p>
		<p>The purpose of this essay is to give godly help, hope, and direction to those who have, in one way or another, put away their spouse and have remarried another.&nbsp; Many have gone this 
		route with the blessings of the church so the sin of adultery is also shared by leadership in the Church.<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			[The priests] feed on the sins of my people and relish their wickedness. – Hosea 4:8</blockquote>
		<p>How does one untie a marriage or undo adultery?&nbsp; The answer is that it is not possible<sup>1</sup>, despite the convoluted exegesis and reasoning by most modern evangelical 
		Protestants.&nbsp; There is not the space here to cite all of the references in Scripture that condemn adultery in the strongest terms.<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral. – Heb. 13:4</blockquote>
		<p>In the United States, the marriage bed has become a merry-go-round at a playground where everyone and everything jumps off and on for the thrill of it.&nbsp; We have become a defiled 
		nation.</p>
		<p>Adultery is so vile that even if the Church does nothing to rightly judge the adulterer, God will take the matter into His own Hands and judge him.&nbsp; Scripture does not precisely say 
		what God will do to him<sup>2</sup>, whether he is repentant or not.</p>
		<p>It has been my observation over the decades that all adulterers, regardless if they repent, experience a sort of spiritual death of some degree, much like what happens to a stroke victim.&nbsp; 
		The stroke victim becomes unaware of what has happened.&nbsp; How frightening it is to die – even partially – in a spiritual manner.&nbsp; Such is the sentence laid upon the adulterer, at the 
		least. </p>
		<p>Adultery is not a "one shot" event like, thievery.&nbsp; A thief steals the goods.&nbsp; Sometime later, he repents.&nbsp; He must apologize to whomever he stole the goods from, make 
		restitution, and then place himself in the hands of the magistrate.&nbsp; If this is done, that is the end of the matter.</p>
		<p>Adultery is different.&nbsp; It is one of the single most hated sins by the Creator.&nbsp; The consequences, even when full repentance is done, are so harmful to so many.</p>
		<blockquote>
			But a man who commits adultery lacks judgment; whoever does so destroys himself.&nbsp; Blows and disgrace are his lot, and his shame will never be wiped away. – Prov. 6:32-33</blockquote>
		<p>There is nothing on earth that can give a spouse such a sense of betrayal and raw pain as the adulterer.</p>
		<p>No amount of time can erase its memory and effects, especially what it does to children.&nbsp; No amount of apologizing, no extent of gifts can satisfy the man whose wife has been defiled 
		by another.&nbsp; Men who lure away other men's wives have been murdered by the offended husband.&nbsp; It is one of the most evil and selfish things a parent can do to his children of the 
		marriage, if there were any.</p>
		<p>This begs the question: what should a couple do if they are in an adulterous relationship?&nbsp; Every time a man goes in and has sexual relations with the wife of another man, he is 
		committing adultery.&nbsp; Now amount of time can change what it is.&nbsp; The 
		<a href="adulterous-marriages/adulterous-marriages.htm#civil_authoritys_role_in_marriage">
		unlawful decrees</a> of the State that a marriage has been "dissolved" have no authority in God's eyes.&nbsp; Only death, as the Scriptures teach, ends a marriage (Rom. 7).</p>
		<p>Both the woman caught in adultery (John 8) and Herod (Matt. 14) were commanded to cease their adulterous relationships – and so must the couple. If there are no children, the couple must 
		demonstrate true repentance.&nbsp; This means they can no longer enjoy conjugal relations with one another.&nbsp; This seems impossible in the sex-crazed culture in which we find ourselves but 
		it should not be for the true Christian who finds his strength in Christ and not in himself.</p>
		<p>The betrayed spouses should be contacted, if possible, apologized to, and informed that the adultery has ceased.&nbsp; If there are children, the family can still live 
		together but the couple must live as sister and brother.&nbsp; Until recent times, this is what the Church taught.&nbsp; But now we live in an ocean of immorality, tossed back and forth by 
		gigantic waves, swept onto rocky coasts where families are dashed to pieces.</p>
		<p>The fact that supposed Christians in the Church must have sex and companionship regardless of what God commands proves that these people are idolaters.&nbsp; When it comes to obedience to 
		Christ in hard matters, they give way.&nbsp; Church leadership has conveniently accommodated the adulterers by engaging in exegetical gymnastics to demonstrate that there is no clear teaching 
		in Scripture concerning the permanence of marriage.&nbsp; Jesus' teaching is hopelessly ambiguous.&nbsp; Paul's teaching, likewise, is fuzzy and "... what did he know, anyway, being a single man?"&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Should the adulterer return to his first wife?&nbsp; This is a difficult question because she may be in the arms of another man, she may not want to, or she cannot.&nbsp; The universal 
		attitude is, "God forbid if I must commit myself to a life of celibacy!"&nbsp; But this is the test if God is God or sex is god.&nbsp; For most, sex is the greater god and, we can say, nothing 
		has changed for eons.</p>
		<p>Deut. 24 teaches that a "once married and then divorced woman" who finds a new husband cannot return to the first husband, even if he dies.&nbsp; In Hosea, the adulterous wife, like Israel, 
		must return to her husband.&nbsp; Is there a conflict here?&nbsp; It is not likely because Hosea's adulterous wife did not marry another.&nbsp; To be safe, all parties can live celibately.&nbsp; 
		Sadly, the visible church is largely indistinguishable from the heathen.</p>
		<p>How can the unregenerate be victorious over the Baal's of our time without the power of the indwelling Holy Spirit?&nbsp; The answer is that they cannot.&nbsp; Only those who are converted 
		by and filled with the Holy Spirit are able to please Him and abide in His commands.</p>
		<p>Suffice it to say, there are numerous commands to the Jews of the OT that are not directly related to the moral law and which no Christian has ever practiced, such as the command to marry 
		the childless widow of a dead brother (Deut. 25).</p>
		<p>For this reason, Jesus' words must trump interpretations of commands found in the Old Testament, such as in Deut. 24.&nbsp; Living celibately seems an impossible task and burden to 
		bear, especially in this godless age and culture where sex is worshipped, depravity indulged, and vice celebrated.&nbsp; But godly Christians, on the other hand, can be assured that they will 
		have the help to do anything He commands.</p>
		<p>Adulterers who later repent should have thought of the consequences before committing such terrible sin.&nbsp; The same goes for soldiers who abandon their posts, for murderers, and for 
		traitors.&nbsp; The enduring havoc all of these people create is incalculable.</p>
		<p>Before things get impossible in your marriage, strive to be a good spouse.&nbsp; Begin with "please" and "thank you".&nbsp; Discover the amazing power of "I'm sorry."</p>
		<p>The heart is exceedingly evil and will concoct any sort of scheme to shift blame to another (the Eve Syndrome).&nbsp; I know a young woman who did this to her husband – hating him and 
		denying him his godly conjugal rights.&nbsp; The poor man could not stand it – and left.&nbsp; She was the one who drove him away, regardless of outward appearances.</p>
		<p>Is there any grace for those who have committed adultery?&nbsp; Is the blood of Christ sufficient to cleanse from this sin? Certainly.</p>
		<p>They must rely on the mercy and grace of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ.&nbsp; The blood of Christ can cleanse from any sin, including adultery but there are always consequences for 
		adulterous unions.&nbsp; The Bible teaches that they are lifelong and will be bitter and difficult.&nbsp; Children are always devastated when their parents cease to love one another.&nbsp; 
		This is why the disciples said it is better not to marry in the first place (Matt. 19:10) rather than remain faithful to an adulteress.</p>
		<h2>What has happened today?</h2>
		<p>There have been periods in the Church Age where the pure faith once delivered to the saints was altered and a majority promoted and believed a falsehood.&nbsp; An example of this was during 
		the 4th century A.D. when Arianism reigned within Christendom.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp; Nonetheless, there were isolated holdouts including Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria.&nbsp; He bravely stood 
		his ground for many years, even suffering banishment by the Emperor.&nbsp; In the end, the men who promoted this heresy either died or lost favor and power in the Roman Empire.&nbsp; Orthodoxy 
		once again was established (or, rather, imposed) among the churches.</p>
		<p>We live in a similar period in the Church today.&nbsp; In particular, the gospel that is preached from most pulpits is fundamentally different from that preached by the Apostles, the Early 
		Church, and taught in the Bible.&nbsp; It is a gospel empty of repentance and obedience – a humanistic gospel that centers around the notion that Jesus came to serve, commune with, and help us 
		attain our goals in life, especially sensuality and "happiness".</p>
		<p>That no obedience is required of the Christian is a perversion of the godly doctrine that we are saved by grace and not by any works.&nbsp; Obedience becomes confused with works and, as 
		such, obedience is condemned.&nbsp; As the Christian theologian, Francis Schaeffer, repeatedly warned the Protestant church in America, "We cannot have love without holiness nor holiness 
		without love."</p>
		<p>Consequently, we should not be surprised by the widespread teaching that marriage is a conditional covenant along with most of the other moral law.&nbsp; Popular Protestant authors on the 
		subject reinforce this myth.&nbsp; Gary Thomas, author of 
		<a href="book-reviews/sacred-marriage-by-Gary-Thomas.htm">Sacred Marriage</a> writes of the so-called exceptions that make marriage conditional – a sort of spiritual irony considering the 
		book's title.&nbsp; On the cover, he asks, "What if God designed marriage to make us holy more than to make us happy?" &nbsp;Catchy rhetorical comments like this from the people who brought us 
		<span class="italics">The Purpose Driven Life</span> should warn us:&nbsp; distortions and misuse of Scripture are about to follow.</p>
		<h2>The Purpose of Marriage</h2>
		<p>Suffice it to say, the purpose of marriage (or, in biblical terms, for a man to take lordship over a woman) is to provide the Creator with godly offspring and for the woman to give 
		companionship and critical help to her man.&nbsp; Woman was created expressly for the well being of the man – not so she could follow some independent course on her own.<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			...the woman is the glory of man.&nbsp; For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. &nbsp;1Cor. 11:7-9</blockquote>
		<p>Contrary to the opinions of most of the Protestant Church, the truth stated above is not some remnant of cultural bias from the 1<sup>st</sup> century but was established at the Creation of 
		the world (Genesis).</p>
		<p>The notion of the overall equality in function, role, and design of the sexes is also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_egalitarianism">egalitarianism</a> and is 
		another perversion of the godly doctrine that all men must be saved the same way.&nbsp; So now not only is the human race saved in the exact same manner (correct) but the sexes are identical 
		in role, design, and function (false).</p>
		<p>Like all heresies, they begin with truth and then mix it with some worldly philosophy (Mal. 2:15; Genesis 2:18; Gal. 3:28).&nbsp; No less a theologian than Walter Kaiser, this writer's 
		former professor of Old Testament at Trinity and now president of Gordon-Conwell, has embraced this distorted doctrine of the Reformation.</p>
		<p>Careful biblical exegesis is the last thing a Christian can expect these days.&nbsp; Leadership has an attitude that is something like this.<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			Why make the whole world angry with screed from the Bible when we can jumble it all up and make it palatable to the worldly-minded and sensual Christian?&nbsp; Why enrage the feminists, the 
			adulterous, and the unrepentant immoral who all finance the operations of the church, including pay my salary?</blockquote>
		<p>In any case, only the blood of Jesus Christ applied to the heart of the sinner makes him holy.<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation.&nbsp; Col. 1:22</blockquote>
		<p>Gary Thomas writes that marriage can be a trial for us, which it often is.&nbsp; But he is mistaken in asserting that it can make us holy.&nbsp; Instead, it makes us mature. (James 1:2ff.)&nbsp; 
		On the other hand, the Scriptures call us to behave in a holy manner.</p>
		<p>Godly Christians know from the Holy Spirit that putting away a spouse is a great evil but pastors often ignore or downplay biblical teaching on it.&nbsp; As a result, the flock may not be 
		entirely to blame for their permissive attitudes on the matter.</p>
		<p>What is worse is that a pastor may callously dump his wife and family for his honey, resign in disgrace, but then just move on and become pastor of another church.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dwight 
		Edwards, former pastor of Grace Bible Church in College Station, TX did this.&nbsp; He is now pastoring a church near Houston with his new honey.&nbsp; I wonder if he ever teaches on holiness 
		for the Christian or on the evils of putting a wife away?&nbsp; Not likely.</p>
		<h2>The current Evangelical teaching<sup>4</sup></h2>
		<p>&nbsp;It goes something like this,<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			As long as my spouse is not adulterous, does not abandon me, and we get along, I will stick with the marriage.&nbsp; Otherwise, not only am I out of the marriage, but I can go and marry another 
			– and another – and another.</blockquote>
		<p>As this writer has observed on multiple occasions, supposedly Christian women can always find some fault with their husbands, e.g., "he had adulterous thoughts which is the same as physical 
		adultery, etc."</p>
		<p>Few Protestant churches in America recognize the orthodox, biblical doctrine that marriage, like Christ's covenant with the Church, is permanent and does not depend on the performance of 
		the other party.&nbsp; Is God's Covenant with Abraham conditional?&nbsp; What about God's Covenant with David?<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			...if we are faithless, he will remain faithful, for he cannot disown himself.&nbsp; 2Tim. 2:13</blockquote>
		<p>It is a rough go.</p>
		<p>Modern Bible translations ignore the established, biblical teaching of the first six centuries of the Church.&nbsp; The Church Fathers were virtually unanimous on this matter – teachings by 
		men whose first language was the Greek of the New Testament and who often paid for their Christian faith with their own blood.&nbsp; Only a few modern pastors hold to the 
		historic Christian position on the permanency of marriage.</p>
		<p>We are not alone in representing the truth of marriage.&nbsp; Not only does the Holy Spirit confirm in us what He has taught from the foundation of the world but there is an <a href="http://www.marriagedivorce.com/index.php">
		international organization</a> based in Canada that has become a clearing house and source of encouragement for any Christian who has bravely stood his ground for the heart of God in this 
		matter.</p>
		<p>Modern English translations follow the Authorized Version in translating just three Greek words in Matt. 19:9 to mean "except for immorality".&nbsp; Then they build a colossal theological 
		structure concerning divorce from it that permeates throughout the rest of their theology.</p>
		<p>The NIV, which is otherwise this writer's favorite English translation, goes even farther in distancing itself from historic Christian teaching on this matter by incorrectly translating the 
		Greek word porneia in Matt. 19:9 as "marital unfaithfulness" instead of "sexual misconduct".&nbsp; "Marital unfaithfulness" is a euphemism for adultery but the Greek word for it is not used 
		here.&nbsp; The phrase is better translated, "...sexual misconduct not withstanding."&nbsp; For a detailed discussion of this and how the Reformers altered the Greek text to align with their 
		flawed views, go 
		<a href="adulterous-marriages/adulterous-marriages.htm">here</a>.</p>
		<p>Those who hold to egalitarianism (men and women are equal in every way) drill down on just one verse (Gal. 3:28) and then interpret every other verse of Scripture with that one verse in 
		mind.</p>
		<p>The established teaching of the Early Church was that nothing dissolves a marriage but death.&nbsp; Remarriage of the surviving partner is not adulterous – that is all.&nbsp; The godly, 
		like the widow in 1Tim. 5 and Anna the Prophetess in Luke 2:36, are better off remaining single.&nbsp; Paul allows young widows with children to remarry rather than unsuccessfully battle the 
		flesh and its cravings.</p>
		<p>Sacrifice and obedience out of gratitude and love for the Savior was a common paradigm, as it was for such men as Paul and Stephen and the 3rd century martyr, Perpetua. This largely changed 
		during the Reformation when new and invisible idols were created.&nbsp; This is not to say that there were not many martyrs whose obedience required great suffering during this period but, 
		unlike earlier times, they did not suffer at the hands of outsiders but from within the Church herself – a great tragedy that was experienced by all sides.&nbsp; 
		</p>
		<p>Many pastors are too happy to please carnal Christians when it comes to trading in the old spouse for new.&nbsp; Churchgoers, as a result, have committed adultery en masse.&nbsp; Most do 
		not care.&nbsp; Some, however, are troubled by the statistics that, both in and out of the Church, most marriages fail.&nbsp; We should take note that Israel was violently thrown out of 
		Jerusalem in the 6th century B.C. for physical and spiritual adultery.&nbsp; Most were killed and a small remnant was sent into exile. To defend the permanence of marriage in the Church today 
		is akin to when Athanasius defended orthodoxy against the Arians – it will bring grief, scorn, and wrath from most of the Church.</p>
		<p>Was the church in Constantinople destroyed by the Creator because of her adulteries? Idolatries?&nbsp; We probably will never know but the debacle of A.D. 1453 should still be a warning of 
		what can happen to a faithless and rebellious church.</p>
		<p>Nonetheless, there is a great difference between separation of a couple as a result of violence, for example, with the notion that anything can actually dissolve a marriage other than the 
		death of a partner.&nbsp; This is what the Scriptures teach and the Church believed and practiced for centuries.</p>
		<p>It is neither prudent, godly, nor safe for a woman to stay in a relationship that threatens the health or safety of her or her children.&nbsp; The difference today compared to most of 
		Church history is that then the woman remained single and in the care and protection of the Church.&nbsp; Today, she is encouraged to marry again even though her first husband may still be 
		alive.<br>
		</p>
		<h2>What Now?</h2>
		<p>You have remarried and then, presumably, became a Christian.&nbsp; Or – more likely – you have followed the false teachings of this age and remarried as a believer.&nbsp; What should you 
		do?</p>
		<h3>1. Confession</h3>
		<p>&nbsp;You must acknowledge before God and the Church that what you have done is one of the greatest evils anyone can do (Psalm 51).&nbsp; In theocratic Israel, the LORD ordered that adulterers, 
		homosexuals, idolaters, and witches be put to death.&nbsp; Christians today falsely believe that God's character and hatred of such things has somehow changed.&nbsp; This is more falsehood.&nbsp; 
		Some of the last words in Scripture (Rev. 22) pronounce terrible judgment on the sexually immoral.&nbsp; It is not some dead and gone hangover from Israel's past.&nbsp; However badly the State 
		fails to procure justice, it still has a God-ordained monopoly on administering civil justice.&nbsp; That is, if the State fails to put to death the witch, the adulterer, and the homosexual, 
		the Church has no responsibility or authority whatsoever to take matters into her hands as a result of the State's failure to do its duty.&nbsp; The State will judged by its Maker soon enough.</p>
		<p>The ancients of Abraham's day considered adultery worse than murder.&nbsp; Even King David, in the throes of sin, knew that Uriah must be put to death for he could not take lordship over 
		Bathsheba if her husband remained alive.</p>
		<p>Thankfully, the Blood of Christ is sufficient to cleanse from any sin (Psalm 51; Gen. 20:2 ff.; 1Cor. 6:9-11).&nbsp; As Paul mentions in 1Cor. 6:11, that is what some godly Christians once 
		were.&nbsp; As sinners, we are ashamed.&nbsp; As the objects of Divine mercy and love, we are filled with hope and joy.&nbsp; But this in no way mitigates the consequences for sin which can 
		include being put to death.&nbsp; If you are a repentant adulterer or homosexual, be thankful that you do not live under Islam or the Mosaic covenant.</p>
		<h3>2. Consequences</h3>
		<p>They are serious for adultery.&nbsp; If you are a man, you cannot assume any teaching or mentoring office in the Church.&nbsp; (However, a divorced and celibate man can still be a one 
		woman man and can serve.&nbsp; He is not an adulterer.)</p>
		<p>John the Baptist understood that the state could not dissolve a marriage and suffered accordingly at the hands of King Herod.&nbsp; Defy the unrepentant adulterous and one risks being put 
		to death.&nbsp; The heathen of our time, including most in the visible church, have a false notion that the divorced are no longer married.&nbsp; In the Creator's eyes, they still are.&nbsp; 
		This makes these men polygamists and are forbidden to hold offices in the Church per 1Tim. 3.</p>
		<p>An adulterer in the Kingdom of God is like a traitor among the kingdoms of men for he has denied the permanency of Christ's covenant with His Bride, the Church of which the marriage of a 
		man and a woman is a picture.&nbsp; None of this was unknown to the Early Church and they taught it among the flock.&nbsp; Those who refused were excommunicated.&nbsp; Now, everything is 
		turned upside down and inside out.&nbsp; It is the godly who are excommunicated and scorned.</p>
		<p>Christians must be careful as there is nothing like adultery to invite Divine Judgment and God's wrath on His disobedient people. (Prov. 6:32-33; 1Tim. 3; Gen. 2:21ff; 9:5-6; Deut. 24:1ff.; 
		Matt. 14:3; 2Sam. 12:14; Rom. 13; Rev 2-3)</p>
		<h3>3. Purity of the Marriage Bed</h3>
		<p>The new union is adulterous, now matter how long it has endured.&nbsp; Both sinned grievously and the blame lies equally on the man and the woman.&nbsp; Guilt must be confessed to the 
		church and to God by them both or, at least, by the Christian man or woman.&nbsp; (We cannot require the outsider to be repentant – they must be a Christian first.)</p>
		<p>They must cease to have sexual relations.&nbsp; Every time the man goes into the woman, he commits adultery – again.&nbsp; The adultery must stop, just as the repentant thief must cease 
		stealing.&nbsp; Herod could not have Herodias.&nbsp; So-called divorce does not change the relationship of a wife to her husband.&nbsp; It endures until the death of a spouse.&nbsp; A man's 
		sister is always his sister, no matter what she does or if she is dead.&nbsp; The LORD does, however, allow widows and widowers to remarry but it is always the best for them to remain as they 
		are.&nbsp; If there are children from the adulterous union, it would be best for the sake of the children if they lived under the same roof.&nbsp; I think it is evident what a mess adultery is 
		and why Christians must shun it.</p>
		<p>The LORD demands nothing more – no self-beatings in the closet.&nbsp; His Blood is sufficient to completely cleanse from the punishment each should receive.&nbsp; There must not be any 
		self-justification or self-pity.&nbsp; They must be able to say with a whole heart,</p>
		<blockquote>
			Yes, LORD, you hate divorce.&nbsp; I have put away the mate of my youth, been adulterous, and deserve your wrath.&nbsp; Have mercy on me. In Jesus' name. Amen.</blockquote>
		<p>He will give a new heart and the strength for them to do what is right.</p>
		<p>The sad truth is that second marriages usually fail which is another reason why they should be avoided in the first place.&nbsp; This to say nothing of the trauma that is caused to any 
		children.&nbsp; What do they think when mom's picture goes down and another woman's goes up over the family mantle?&nbsp; What's wrong with my mom/dad?&nbsp; It is hurtful against any children 
		and why re-marriage should never occur.</p>
		<p>It is not godly for parents to put their physical needs above the spiritual and emotional health of their offspring.&nbsp; This is to say nothing of putting such needs above obedience to 
		God – the essence of idolatry.&nbsp; Even heathen psychologists suggest that the biological parents stick together – however imperfectly – until their children are gone from the home.</p>
		<p>The Church has failed in our land on this front and continues to give her blessing to adulterous unions.&nbsp; The Holy Spirit commands us in the Church to keep the marriage bed pure and 
		undefiled. Most pastors do the opposite.&nbsp; Those who perform such second marriages have helped the church culture continue its slide into irrelevancy and towards judgment by the Creator.&nbsp; 
		They may be more interested in being public relations agents for the sin nature than in being His faithful shepherds (Heb. 13:4; 1Cor. 7:5; 3John).<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God's holy people. – Ephesians 5:3<br>
			<br>God's solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: "The Lord knows those who are his, "and, "Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness." 
			– 2Tim 2:19</blockquote>
