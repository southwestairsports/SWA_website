		<blockquote>
			You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. – Exodus 20:4</blockquote>
		Throughout the ages, many have been troubled by images of the Eternal. This can include paintings of the Christ, depictions of the Father in some way, icons, and whatnot.&nbsp; In particular, pious 
		Jews before the First Coming (from what little we know of them, including the Prophets) would likely have some reservations about the abundance, for example, of movies depicting the life, 
		death, and resurrection of the Lord. <br><br>Should we just ignore the 2nd Commandment?&nbsp; What constitutes making an idol?&nbsp; The Commandment is fairly clear …in the form of anything….&nbsp; What does 
		“anything” mean?&nbsp; Is it anything?&nbsp; Or most things, excepting what church authorities might consider to be an idol of some sort?<br><br>Perhaps the following could be a sort of test.&nbsp; If 
		whatever it is, is defaced, destroyed by fire, stolen, publicly mocked by the heathen, or subject to some other malicious act – what is our response?&nbsp; Are we deeply disturbed?&nbsp; Our faith 
		shaken?&nbsp; Or, would we consider it similar to having the photo of some popular public official defaced?&nbsp; Whatever our response might be, it would be a telltale sign of whether our hearts might 
		harbor some form of idolatry: The actual connection of some form of matter with the Eternal or some false god.<br><br>Idolatry is so widely condemned in Scripture from one end to the other 
		that we should not have to make a case of what it is.&nbsp; Like the heathen, it is all too easy to connect, for example, the golden calves of King Jeroboam and of the high priest Aaron with the 
		unseen.&nbsp; How are we, as fallen corrupt humans, any different in the heart than they?&nbsp; As converted men, we can know better – hopefully. <br><br>Consider the taking of Constantinople in 1453 
		A.D. by the monotheistic heathen, the Muslims. The central cathedral, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagia_Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a> (360-1453 A.D.), was converted to a mosque. Was 
		this a desecration or some sacrilegious act? Or, was it the mere invasion of building used for worship? It is a good question for the Christian to answer.<br><br>To see a church building 
		burned and looted should be something like having the same done to our own home. It would be tragic loss. But would we be horrified and broken over one but not the other?<br><br>I think it is 
		question worth asking. <br><br>What did the Christ look like to human eyes? Which movie actor or painting accurately depicts His image? Which one do you like and why? “He looked like this!” 
		“He looked like that!” “Angels have wings!”<br><br>I am not about to tell anyone what an idol is. But these are issues worth considering as our hearts – even as God’s Elect – are easily led 
		astray. Just look at the immorality, divorce, and adultery among Christians. Apparently, the 7th Commandment takes on a relevancy about the same as the 2nd.<br><br>I have seen Hindus kneel and 
		pray before a handsome little statue. Is the only reason that this may be idolatry is that the god/goddess is patently non-existent?&nbsp; Why the 2nd Commandment?
