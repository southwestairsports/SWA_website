	<p>by Hadley Robinson</p>
	
	
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>A firm and biblically based understanding of why God created the woman, her purpose in this life, and her rank and status will aid the pious Christian woman in her resolve to please her 
		Savior.</p>
		<p>The Bible is coherent in its teaching concerning the woman but most have chosen to ignore it, making studied excuses without limit and creativity.</p>
		<p>In these times it is unfortunate that the culture in which we find ourselves has abandoned the foundations necessary for long term cultural, political, and economic health or, in other 
		words, for an orderly, prosperous, and peaceful civilization. It is also a period when personal holiness is largely scorned by most in the churches.&nbsp; This pervasive heresy, also known as
		<a href="antinomianism.htm">antinomianism</a>, has dogged the Church since the Creation:&nbsp; it is easy to have the form of true religion but abandon its substance.</p>
		<p>But when in any period of history has the Israel of God not adopted – by and large – the practices of the godless heathen in which she has found herself?&nbsp; It is a serious crisis which 
		is not likely to be reversed by any peaceful means, if both secular and church history are examples. 		</p>
		<p>It is not just the woman who lives in an ocean of confusion, lies, and other schemes of the Devil. The man, too, has lost his bearings as to his role and responsibilities – but that is not 
		the subject of this essay. </p>
		<p>The woman who is confident of her identity and purpose can also instruct the younger women, including her own daughters. She can inspire them to the high calling of Christian obedience 
		rather than succumb to the rebellious feminist culture that has overwhelmed us. </p>
		<p>The obedient will be richly blessed by our Savior, as was Ruth, with everlasting honor. </p>
		<blockquote>Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: "Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all." – Prov. 31:28-29</blockquote>
		<blockquote>He who does not love me will not obey my teaching. – John 14:23</blockquote>
		<p>It seems that there is a great number of women in the churches who say they love Christ but do not act like they do. The godly and ungodly women are contrasted here: </p>
		<blockquote>The wise woman builds her house, but with her own hands the foolish one tears hers down. – Prov. 14:1</blockquote>
		<p>Women who abandon their created purpose can expect trouble or disaster in their homes and marriages. But those who humbly submit to the Creator’s purpose for them will find themselves as 
		great oak trees in well-watered and fertile soil with abundant fruit and roots that go down deeply. Such roots can withstand the most violent storms and periods of drought. </p>
		<h3>1. Her Purpose</h3>
		<h4>a. Critical Helper to her man</h4>
		<blockquote>The LORD God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him." – Gen. 2:18</blockquote>
		<p>A better translation of the Hebrew word for “helper” (“help meet” KJV) might be “critical helper”. This is because of the use of the Hebrew root elsewhere which is overwhelmingly of the 
		LORD being Israel’s helper. The Hebrew word has a military sense which is why “critical helper” is more accurate. </p>
		<p>In English, we might ask, “I need some help.” For what? If it is someone who needs a hand for some task like removing boxes from a pickup, it is one matter. If someone needs help who is 
		being overcome by a vicious enemy in battle that is another matter, entirely. The context of the Hebrew word is the latter. An example of the use of this word elsewhere in this sense is here 
		in Deuteronomy. </p>
		<blockquote>Blessed are you, O Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD? He is your shield and helper and your glorious sword. – Dt. 33:29
		</blockquote>
		<p>The woman, therefore, has been expressly created to provide critical assistance to her husband. She was not created as an independent being or some sort of partner.&nbsp; A good example of 
		a critical helper is the wife described in Prov. 31. She is about the business of her house which she governs under the authority of her husband. Her concern is not her own glory and success 
		but that of her husband. </p>
		<blockquote>She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life. – Prov. 31:12</blockquote>
		<p>On the other hand, the wife of today who is like Eve is the more typical: deceived and rebellious against both God and her husband.</p>
		<p>Queen Jezebel (1Ki. 18) is another example of how a wife pursuing her own interests brought disaster to her family. </p>
		<p>Queen Athaliah (2 Ki. 11:1ff) was another woman driven by selfish ambition. So intense were her lusts for glory and power that she murdered her own grandchildren to achieve her evil 
		cravings. While many a self-styled “church woman” has not taken a knife to her descendants, she <span class="italics">has taken</span> leave of her home and husband.&nbsp; While her children 
		may not have been murdered, they are, nonetheless, damaged in other ways as children are whose mother lets them know, in one way or another, that they are not her first love or priority. </p>
		<p>The difference between Athaliah and too many women in the church today is one of degree, not of essence. The connection between motive and deed is well established in Scripture. Jesus 
		taught this when he connected anger and murder (Mt. 5:21ff). Our loving grandma, Athaliah, took the connection to its extreme. </p>
		<p>The woman who excuses the lack of love for her children and her skewed priorities has acted like the foolish and evil Athaliah.</p>
		<p>The Hebrew word for "foolish" describes senselessness accompanied by a defect in character. It is not someone who is just simple minded but one who also willfully engages in evil or 
		destructive behavior. </p>
		<p>A godly wife is a guardian of her husband and home. She should be a fearless lioness when she finds an immoral woman throwing herself at her man. She considers the order, tranquility, 
		cleanliness, comfort, and health of her home for her husband and family to be her first priority. She is like the godly woman of Prov. 31 and the women who surrounded Jesus. </p>
		<blockquote>Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs. – Matt. 27:55 </blockquote>
		<p>These godly women knew what to do and provided critical help to the Son of God, our Savior. Certainly, they were blessed all the more for the loving help they bestowed upon Him. </p>
		<h4>b. She is to bear children</h4>
		<blockquote>As for you, be fruitful and increase in number; multiply on the earth and increase upon it. – Gen. 9:7 </blockquote>
		<blockquote>Has not the LORD made them one? In flesh and spirit they are his. And why one? Because he was seeking godly offspring. – Mal. 2:15. 
		</blockquote>
		<p>The people of most European nations are aborting and contracepting themselves out of existence. Their mindset is that having children is an expensive and burdensome task which has no short 
		term benefit. This attitude gives scant regard to man's duties to God.</p>
		<p>As Saul Bellow once wrote, “<span class="italics">We are firmly in the grip of ideas rather than in the grip of nature.</span>” The idea of today that has gripped the people of western 
		nations is described here in Isaiah 22:13-14, </p>
		<blockquote>But see, there is joy and revelry, slaughtering of cattle and killing of sheep, eating of meat and drinking of wine! "Let us eat and drink," you say, "for tomorrow we die!" The 
			LORD Almighty has revealed this in my hearing: "Till your dying day this sin will not be atoned for," says the Lord, the LORD Almighty. </blockquote>
		<p>The way of life condemned here denies the resurrection of the dead and God’s sovereignty over His creation. There are many self-described Christians in the church who have the same 
		attitude. </p>
		<blockquote>You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless? – James 2:20 </blockquote>
		<p>There are many in the church today whose faith is useless…. </p>
		<p>In the United State responsible parenthood is neither encouraged nor supported. The most obvious example is the black communities where immorality and adultery are universal. Only 10% of 
		these people have children born to married parents.&nbsp; Such behavior bears a terrible cost and is unsupportable in the long run.
		</p>
		<p>The Christian home, on the other hand, is a place of sacrifice and responsibility for the long term physical and spiritual health of the children.&nbsp; The home is not some parking place 
		for disparate people to share living costs....</p>
		<p>Immorality – and adultery in particular – are insidious evils that should be punished most severely only if to dissuade others from such destructive sin. This to say nothing concerning the 
		Creator’s fury that will be unleashed against the unrepentant who have lain with the husband or wife of another (Heb. 13:4). </p>
		<p>The godly woman has her child bearing responsibilities faithfully given to God, as did the Virgin Mary.</p>
		<blockquote>May it be to me as you have said. – Luke 1:38.</blockquote>
		<p>It is not difficult to understand why modern American women hate Christians so intensely and the God they serve. The former deeply embrace their immoralities and the abortions that must be 
		done when contraception fails.&nbsp; They are like men who continually feast but not for nourishment and good health, but out of gluttony. </p>
		<p>Would you, Christian woman, desire to be like the most godly women in history?&nbsp; Mary, the mother of Jesus, is the arch-type of the Christian woman. She bravely and willingly submitted 
		to the Word, rejoicing at the prospect of bearing the Son who later secured our reconciliation with God.</p>
		<p>How is there any blessing from God for the rebellious shrew?</p>
		<h3>2. Rank &amp; Status</h3>
		<blockquote>For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh. – Gen. 2:24</blockquote>
		<h4>a. One Flesh</h4>
		<p>The word “flesh” means that the wife’s relationship to her husband becomes even more binding than a man’s relationship to his own sister. </p>
		<p>The husband and wife relationship is of greater supremacy, durability, and strength than that of father and son, the strongest blood relationship there is.</p>
		<p>Accordingly, the word “united” would be better translated as “to hold fast in undeviating loyalty.” This is the contextual meaning used throughout the Hebrew Bible. </p>
		<p>It is the same word used in Ruth 1:14, rendered there as “cling”. </p>
		<blockquote>At this they wept again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her. – Ru 1:14 </blockquote>
		<blockquote>But Ruth replied, "Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. 
			Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me." When Naomi realized that Ruth was 
			determined to go with her, she stopped urging her. – Ru 1:16-18 </blockquote>
		<p>Ruth’s response to her mother-in-law is a well set diamond surrounded by rubies. The depth of her commitment, love, and devotion to another person helps define the meaning of the Hebrew 
		word used here and in Gen. 2:24. Ruth declares herself joined to Naomi where</p>
		<ol class="italics">
			<li>Grounds for separation are not even open to discussion.</li>
			<li>She will be a companion to Naomi without reservation.</li>
			<li>She will identify with Naomi’s family and not her own.</li>
			<li>She will adopt Naomi’s faith unreservedly.</li>
			<li>Only death will separate her from Naomi which Ruth affirms by swearing a terrible oath before God.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Such is also the gravity and depth of the marriage covenant.&nbsp; But most men find this level of loyalty and commitment tedious and temporary.</p>
		<p>But Bible translations leave out critically important definitions of such key words, even often changing the meanings to suit people's tastes, among which is the notion that marriage is not 
		a permanent relationship broken only by death.</p>
		<p>Men who betray the wives of their youth, for example, cannot be trusted and, as such, cannot be Church leaders. They are men who will forever bear their disgrace in this life – it will 
		never be wiped away (Prov. 6:33).&nbsp; They are men who are not above reproach.&nbsp; They are bad examples in the most important area of a man's life.&nbsp; They are not failures but 
		traitors.&nbsp; This is affirmed by the Apostle in 1 Tim. 3.&nbsp; And men who marry divorced women are also adulterers.&nbsp; Contrary to popular evangelical Protestant teaching, there is no 
		"second chance" at marriage.</p>
		<p>The woman is bound to her husband in an extraordinary way that is permanent.&nbsp; The feminists dismiss this entirely.</p>
		<h4>b. Subordinate to her man</h4>
		<p>Ever since the Garden of Eden, the woman has striven to supersede her husband.&nbsp; It is the inclination of the fallen human nature. </p>
		<blockquote>…and you will be like God…. – Gen. 3:5 </blockquote>
		<p>The purpose of marriage is to provide the Creator with godly offspring and for the woman to be a companion and a critical helper to her man. She was not created for some other purpose, such 
		as following some independent course on her own. </p>
		<p>The Hebrew text reinforces the woman’s rank in Creation.</p>
		<p>What is translated as “to marry” is actually a phrase in Hebrew that is literally “to take lordship over a woman” (Gen. 20:3) or “to take a woman” (Gen. 24:67).</p>
		<p>The Word of God has these commands given by Paul and Peter,</p>
		<blockquote>...the woman is the glory of man. For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. – 1 Cor. 11:7-9<br><br>Wives, submit to 
			your husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also 
			wives should submit to their husbands in everything. – Eph. 5:22-24<br><br>A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over 
			a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. But women will be saved through 
			childbearing--if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. – 1 Tim 2:11-15<br><br>For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to make 
			themselves beautiful. They were submissive to their own husbands, 6 like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her master. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give 
			way to fear. – 1 Pet 3:5-6</blockquote>
		<p>Contrary to the opinions of most in the Protestant Church, the truth expressed in 1 Cor. 11; Eph. 5, Col. 3; 1 Tim. 2; and 1 Pet. 3 is not some remnant of cultural bias from the 1st century 
		but truth established at the Creation of the world as recorded in Genesis.</p>
		<p>The rebellious shrew, as mentioned earlier, wants nothing to do with obedience to God's Word.</p>
		<p>If someone denies the historicity and accuracy of the Book of Genesis, then “all bets are off” for discerning knowable truth about what a woman (or man) really is. Functionally, this is 
		where we are in American culture today and the results are apparent: a person's cravings and lusts determine everything in his life.</p>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>We live in a land filled with the depraved and degenerate who will, in short time, act like the men of Belial they are (Jud. 19:22).</p>
		<p>The majority of our population will happily go along with whatever their leaders declare – the latter being content to impose their radical culture on everyone, even with deadly force.</p>
		<p>Misunderstanding or rejecting a woman’s created role and stature has dire consequences.&nbsp; We are beginning to see the Devil's fruit mature as lawlessness and disorder spreads, 
		especially among the youth.</p>
		<p>It is an easy jump from errors of this kind to what happened in the German church of the 1930’s when entire classes of people lost their claim to being human by the mass rejection of 
		biblical truth.&nbsp; Pious and godly Christians in the U.S. could go from being generally despised to being murdered by the heathen in our land.</p>
		<p>American homosexuals now have their hands on weapons of mass destruction.&nbsp; Will they remain content to allow God's prophets to continue condemning their vile practices?&nbsp; In the 
		U.K., condemning these men is a serious crime as some of the brothers have discovered.</p>
		<p>It is coming here soon.&nbsp; What is our witness going to be?</p>
		<p>The godly woman (or man) is one who submits to divine authority and rule.&nbsp; If the reader of this essay does not have the desire to submit, it is likely that he is not converted and is 
		one of those mentioned in the words of Jesus below.&nbsp; Will we be ready for "<span class="italics">That Day</span>?"&nbsp; It will be here soon enough when Jesus separates the wheat and the 
		chaff -- the sheep and the goats -- the obedient and the disobedient.</p>
		<blockquote>Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.&nbsp; Many will say to me on that day, "Lord, 
			Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?"&nbsp; Then I will tell them plainly, "I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!" -- 
			Matt. 7:21-23</blockquote>
