	<p>by Hadley Robinson</p>
	
	
		<p>Current standards for church leadership continue to plunge, taking on the character of the pagan culture around us.&nbsp; We should not be surprised as even in the earliest periods of the 
		Church this cancer had to be addressed.</p>
		<p>As a result, we have epistles such as 3 John where the entrepreneurial Diotrephes discovered that he was gifted with charismatic leadership and used his skills to cut off "competitors" 
		while advancing himself.&nbsp; The Greek describes him as a "wanting-to-be-firster."&nbsp; These types deceive their way past unsuspecting church boards, ensconce themselves as pastors, and 
		then begin to gather around them wolves, the incompetent, and/or the unqualified who are all too happy to do their bidding.</p>
		<p>What may be some lessons for the church here?</p>
		<p>1.&nbsp; PATIENCE -- We want to believe candidates who are seeking offices in the Church, just like we want to believe the words of potential husbands and Presidents.&nbsp; It is so easy 
		but this is foolish: candidates for the highest offices in the Church must be carefully and patiently examined – no holes barred, no pages unturned.&nbsp; More than not, we are careless and 
		think, "...if it's a disaster, it won't happen during my watch."&nbsp; We must heed the Spirit's advice in 1Timothy 5:22 and never be in a hurry.&nbsp; But that's the disease of our culture:&nbsp; 
		We are in a hurry.</p>
		<p>2.&nbsp; TESTED -- Men for such high office must be tested (1Tim. 3:10).&nbsp; That is, they must serve in lesser offices for some time (years) to prove who they are.&nbsp; We should not 
		advance a man to the role of pastor who has never pastored before under the supervision of another experienced pastor.&nbsp; Smooth speech can deceive and we must resist the temptation.</p>
		<p>For too many, the church is a stepping stone on the road to worldly greatness.&nbsp; And God help those who get in the way of ambitious men.<br><br>3. &nbsp;PUBLIC -- All affairs of the church 
		must be public lest the reputation of the Church be furthered sullied:<br>"As it is written: 'God's name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.'" Romans 2:24<br></p>
		<p>Godly and qualified leadership is very precious and in short supply:&nbsp; men who love the flock of God enough to live or die with them; men who are patient and forgiving; men who do not 
		put themselves first; men who are not easily slighted; men who consider it a supreme joy to suffer for Christ and His Kingdom; men who love their wives as Christ loved the Church and gave 
		Himself for her; men who manage their families well; men who have the courage to confront the wealthy unrepentant in their churches, fearing Christ the Head Shepherd rather than those whose 
		finances pay their salaries; men whose reputations and character among outsiders are spotless; men who love and know well the Word of God in its panoramic fullness; men whose greatest desire 
		is to be with Christ but must remain for the sake of the flock whom they serve.</p>
		<p>Oh LORD, be merciful to your people and bless us with such shepherds.</p>
