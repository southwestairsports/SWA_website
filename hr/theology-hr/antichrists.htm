			Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour. - 1Jn. 2:18</blockquote>
		&nbsp;1.&nbsp; They are false teachers/deceivers and have disguised themselves (Matt. 24:4; Rom.16:18; 2Th. 2:10; 1Jn. 2:18-19). <br><br>2.&nbsp; They cannot abide the presence of God's Elect for long and 
		will eventually separate themselves from them (2Jn. 2:19). <br><br>3.&nbsp; They reject the truth concerning the most important of all Christian doctrines:&nbsp; That Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ, 
		God's Son come in the flesh, the Lamb slain for His people who are the elect of God (1Jn. 2:20-21,26-27). <br><br>4.&nbsp; They have no part in God's salvation nor do what is right (1Jn. 
		2:24-25,29).&nbsp; They are experts in using sexual immorality to destroy men's souls (Num. 25:1ff; Jude 4,7; Rev. 2:14). <br><br>5.&nbsp; They do not walk in love but pretend to do so (2Jn. 1:6,10). <br><br>
		6.&nbsp; The world is their home and those who are perishing listen to them (1Jn. 4:5; 2Th. 2:9-11). <br><br>7.&nbsp; They take their orders from their master, the Antichrist (Rev. 13:2). <br><br>8.&nbsp; 
		They have amazing political skills and may have miraculous powers, like their master (Matt. 24:24; Rev. 13:14).<br><br>If we consider the deeds and character of the real Christ, we only need 
		to consider the opposites to arrive at the character of Antichrist and the antichrists.&nbsp; Sexual immorality and idols are among their most important weapons used to attack men (2Pet. 2:14-15; 
		Rev. 2:14).&nbsp; The current President of the United States is most likely an antichrist.
