		<p>After a sermon on what the disciples understood to be the end of the world as they knew it, they asked the following questions:<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>"Tell us," they said, "when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?" - Matt. 24:3<br><br>“I tell you the truth, this generation will 
			certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.”&nbsp; -Matt.24:34: NIV.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>There are a number of explanations. The apparent difficulty is that Jesus made an error by incorrectly telling the disciples that these events would happen during their lifetime.&nbsp; This 
		view is often used by the God-haters to discredit the author of the Gospel or Jesus Himself.<br>
		<br>Many biblical scholars suggest that “generation” also means “race”. That is, the race of Jews will not pass away until all things above would come to pass. That is, they will be present 
		when the end of the world comes which is what Scripture teaches.&nbsp; According to Gleason Archer (OT professor at Trinity International University) this is the best explanation.&nbsp; Many 
		other scholars agree.&nbsp; Dr. Archer notes that as Jesus spoke Aramaic to the disciples, the Aramaic word can easily mean either race (class of people) or generation.<br><br>Paul never 
		hinted that the world would end during his lifetime or the lifetime of the disciples. That he was familiar with the Gospels is evident in his writings. The same could be said of the Church 
		Fathers.&nbsp; If there was a problem with the text of Matthew on such an important subject as the 2nd Coming, they would surely have mentioned it.<br><br>
		Others suggest (including the 18th century commentator Matthew Henry) that Jesus is referring only to the destruction of the temple/Jerusalem in 70 AD – which He foresaw.&nbsp; In this 
		interpretation, Jesus answers only the first question.<br><br>The scholarly reference work, New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology (NIDNTT), notes that the other references in 
		the NT to "this generation" are pejorative in nature and refer to a class or race of people who have acted wickedly.&nbsp; Therefore, Jesus is not referring to the disciples specifically but 
		to the Jews of the time as a whole and of whom He had nothing good to say (Mk. 8:38, 9:19; Matt. 12:39, 17:17; Lk. 11:29).<br><br>This affirms Dr. Archer's view that the Jews will witness not 
		only the destruction of the Temple but also Jesus' Second Coming and the End of the World as we know it.&nbsp; This is most likely the correct view and one that maintains the context of the 
		phrase "this generation" given in the New Testament.&nbsp; In light of this, it might be better and less confusing to refer to the Greek word (genea) as a “class of people” rather than a 
		“race”.<br>
