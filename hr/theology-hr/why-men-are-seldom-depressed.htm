		OK, guys, you better be sure your woman is NEVER depressed.&nbsp; “Love your wife as Christ loved the Church and gave Himself for her.”<br><br>The Church has been largely adulterous over the ages – 
		but we must not be so, especially to our wives.&nbsp; It is not an easy job being a wife/woman – just go through childbirth with them and thank your lucky stars it is not you getting your insides 
		ripped up, detached, and pushed around and being reminded every month that it can happen, as God wills, again.<br>
		<br>Remember Rachael who gave her life for one of the Patriarchs.&nbsp; It was God’s will that she should die bearing Benjamin.&nbsp; Her husband loved her dearly – consider his sorrow.&nbsp; Thanks to God’s 
		grace, we rarely experience such tragedy today.&nbsp; But for that grace I would be a widower and have not my youngest beauty. &nbsp; The children your wife bears are your children – and it was terrific 
		conceiving them for you and her but she is the one who bears the serious risks and pain.&nbsp; Meditate on this when you are angry with her…. &nbsp; I do not know who penned it.... &nbsp; Hadley Robinson

		$20, even though it's only for $32.50. None of them will have anything smaller and none will actually admit they want change back.<br>·&nbsp;When the girls get their bill, out come the pocket 
		calculators.<br>MONEY<br>·&nbsp;A man will pay $2 for a $1 item he needs.<br>·&nbsp;A woman will pay $1 for a $2 item that she doesn't need but it's on sale.<br>BATHROOMS<br>·&nbsp;A man has six items in his 
		bathroom: toothbrush and toothpaste, shaving cream, razor, a bar of soap, and a towel.<br>·&nbsp;The average number of items in the typical woman's bathroom is 337. A man would not be able to
