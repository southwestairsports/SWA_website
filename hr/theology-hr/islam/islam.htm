		<h2>Some quotes on Islam from the Koran and other sources</h2>
		<blockquote>
			Make war on the unbelievers and the hypocrites and deal rigorously with them. – Koran 9:73<br><br>Those that … spread disorders in the land shall be put to death or crucified or have their 
			hands and feet cut off on alternate sides, or be banished from the country.” - Koran 5:33<br><br>Islam will always be the religion of 9/11; of leering idiots beheading fellow human beings 
			in front of a camera; of suicide bombers; of lay-abouts turned into flash mobs; of creativity and action applied to death and destruction instead of building communities and economies; of 
			constant whining about and disproportionate avenging of perceived insults.&nbsp; Its prophet will always be the huckster of a dysfunctional desert culture with a throwback god of petty rules 
			and monstrous bloodlust.&nbsp; There’s a shiny new Islamic Center here in Sioux Falls, and I just roll my eyes every time I pass by.&nbsp; It will always strike me as a kind of blight, just as much 
			as a crack house or strip bar. – <a href="http://www.standfirminfaith.com/index.php/sf/page/29448/">
			Timothy Fountain</a><br><br>Muslims can say that slavery is not legitimate now, and that crucifixion is wrong at this historical juncture. Many say precisely this. But they cannot condemn 
			slavery or crucifixion outright without contradicting the Koran and the example of the Prophet. "The only principled ground that the Islamic State's opponents could take is to say that 
			certain core texts and traditional teachings of Islam are no longer valid," Bernard Haykel says. That really would be an act of apostasy. – <span>

			Graeme Wood</a>, The Atlantic</span><br><br>Mohammed, the founder of Islam, gives us in the Koran a system containing four dogmas of fundamental immorality, namely, polygamy, slavery, 
			persecution, and suppression of private judgment.&nbsp; Mohammedanism is heathenism in monotheistic form.&nbsp; ...it denies the death of Christ and sees no need of atonement.&nbsp; The power of sin is 
			not recognized.&nbsp; ...Forgiveness is indulgence, and the conception of God is emptied of the quality of justice.&nbsp; Evil belongs only to the individual, not to the race.&nbsp; ...There is no 
			penitence or humility, but only self-righteousness; and this self-righteousness is consistent with great sensuality, unlimited divorce, and with absolute despotism in family, civil, and

		<h2>Personal Note</h2>
		<p>If you are a follower of Islam and have stumbled on this site, know that I, the author of this essay, have great respect for the courage, self-sacrifice, and honor of all who, with a whole 
		heart, follow your prophet.&nbsp; In my travels through nations dominated by Islam, I was always treated with the greatest kindness and care.&nbsp; This is a great credit to Islam.&nbsp; I and 
		my companion were greatly surprised that we could leave, by orders of the Muslim guards, our valuable belongings outside in a pile near the Dome of the Rock and they would still be there when 
		we returned from our tour of this site.&nbsp; Among thousands of pilgrims milling about, our goods were still there when we returned.</p>
		<h2>
		Introduction</h2>
		<p>Islam and their followers have dominated much of the news during the last four decades.&nbsp; The event that brought it to the greater attention of the world was the
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis">OPEC oil embargo</a> 
		of 1973.&nbsp; OPEC itself was created as a result of the catastrophic Six Day War of 1967 when Israeli forces trounced the combined Arab forces of the region.&nbsp; The war was a severe 
		humiliation of the pan-Arab world and, additionally, for Islam.&nbsp;<br><br>
		The war raised questions like this:&nbsp; Did their god care about the welfare of his followers?&nbsp; Had he abandoned them to the infidels of the West?&nbsp;
		<img alt="Slay those who insult Islam" src="1.jpg" width="380" height="235" class="img-float-left"><br><br>
		Prior to this time, the world of Islam was still suffering the humiliating defeats of both World Wars where their former caliphates were divided up into Western style nations by non-Muslims 
		with scant regard to the faith of the people.<br><br>
		What a contrast this was to the stunning victories of Muslim armies during the Middle Ages, especially the taking of
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople">
		Constantinople</a> by Sultan Mehmet II in AD 1453.&nbsp; The retaking of Jerusalem from the Crusaders by Salah ad-Din Yusuf (commonly known as Saladin) in AD 1187 also provided great honor to 
		Islam despite the fact that it was – and still is – a savage and bloodthirsty worldview that allows none but its own.&nbsp; Just as in the 6th century, true followers of Islam have only one 
		goal:&nbsp;force conversion on all peoples of the world.&nbsp; If they will not convert or submit to the Koran's rules for outsiders, they must be exterminated.<br><br>
		Then came the discovery of oil in Arab lands in the early 20th century.&nbsp; This gave heads of state in the region great wealth and – to the further humiliation of Islam – a strong interest 
		in their preserving the status quo with the Western powers.<br><br>
		The result was that regional Arab governments had to largely cooperate with the nations that had developed their resources and with the United States, in particular.&nbsp; Regional governments 
		had to suppress the desire for Islamic government (a.k.a. sharia) among their own people.&nbsp; Leaders were often more interested in their own power, wealth, and influence than in defending 
		Islam.&nbsp; Muslim priests understood that Islam was becoming more religious sentiment than a governing authority which encompassed the entire man, including every detail of his life and 
		death.&nbsp; They began to fight back and a new word entered the languages of the world:&nbsp;jihad or Holy War.<br><br>
		Up until recent times, worldwide jihad had been waged intermittently and mostly against Jews, especially since 1948.&nbsp; But then Al Qaeda, with U.S. help, threw the great Soviet war machine 
		out of Afghanistan.&nbsp; With the Taliban in control, Al Qaeda had a refuge to train and indoctrinate fighters for the world crusade against the West, particularly against America and Israel.<img alt="behead those who insult Islam" src="2.jpg" class="img-float-right"><br><br>
		Then 9/11 happened. Complacent Americans had Islam shoved into their faces with blood and so started a more open war with the&nbsp;followers of Islam.&nbsp; Yet, the lords of American culture 
		continue to deny the truth about Islam and its inherent violence.&nbsp; Recent Presidents and their followers have called this conflict "The War on Terror."&nbsp; This is a falsehood.&nbsp; 
		All true Muslims know that it is nothing less than "The War on Islam."&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<br><br>
		Islam began to have greater success.&nbsp; Their leaders understand that Americans are not fond of long term conflicts as typified by the Viet Nam War.&nbsp; The U.S. has largely abandoned 
		Iraq. In 2008 we elected an inexperienced, feckless, radical ideologue as President.&nbsp; He has stated that he is going to lessen America's impact on containing global terror, i.e., we will 
		surrender to jihad.<br><br>Afghanistan hangs in the balance and may revert to the Taliban at any moment (as of 2013).&nbsp;&nbsp; As one Taliban fighter noted, <span class="italics">"The 
		American troops have watches.&nbsp; We have time."</span>&nbsp; Afghanistan under a revitalized Taliban will provide explosive energy to jihadist forces around the world, especially in Europe.<br><br>
		Like most of the West, European nations are run by women or men acting like women which, when translated, means they are frightened of Islam and its army of terrorists.&nbsp; Feminists in the 
		U. S., not being subject to the draft, will send mostly young white men to suffer and die for preserving this bankrupt culture.&nbsp; But will they take orders from the feminists and their 
		drone collaborators e.g. the current "commander in chief" who acts, in most respects, like a woman?<br><br>What real man would die to preserve the economic, cultural, and political bankruptcy 
		of the U.S., anyway?&nbsp; Do you want to die to preserve the hypocritical American feminists who -- to a woman -- refuse to carry the real burdens of the deadly business of making successful 
		war and, instead, force it on young men?&nbsp; Do you want to preserve the right of homosexuals to have sex with each other while they continue their rampage against the honor and dignity of 
		monogamous homosexual marriage?&nbsp; Think carefully about it.....<br><br>
		It was a serious miscalculation by the West that tribal Afghanistan could be subdued.&nbsp; Alexander the Great, the brutal Soviet Army, and a host of others could not conquer this country so 
		how can Americans do a job these others could not?&nbsp; All the bombs, gunships, drones, missiles, heavy artillery, and the best trained and equipped troops in the world are unlikely to 
		accomplish such a task without mass slaughter of the native people.&nbsp; Where else in the world do you have soldiers who are this tough, brave, and experienced?&nbsp; They have fought 
		against the "big powers" and won.<br><br>The U.S. government does not have the will power to initiate such a slaughter against a foreign people.&nbsp; But, sadly, it has shown that it would 
		not hesitate to slaughter its own -- an easy job.&nbsp; Abraham Lincoln had a similar view and was the father, along with Napoleon, of modern genocide against people who, simply, did not want 
		to be dominated by foreigners.<br><br>Another President, Franklin Roosevelt, sent innocent Americans to concentration camps during WWII.<br><br>Those who protest the current state of affairs 
		can expect harsh reprisals.&nbsp; The irony is that the Taliban fighter will likely have a better go at survival than godly, peaceful Christians in the United States.&nbsp; <br><br>At this 
		time (2014), U. S. agencies are building concentration camps, hoarding ammunition, and organizing a national (and unconstitutional) constabulary under the direct control of the President.&nbsp; 
		Who are those camps for?&nbsp; Who are they planning to massacre?&nbsp; They are probably for white men who do not like the racist (and lawless) policies of the current regime.&nbsp; The 
		regime, their press allies, and the homosexuals act like the Nazi Brownshirts and the Red Guards.<br><br>
		Leaders of Islam know that the hope of Americans and their allies is solely in this world and, as a result, people here are terrified of suffering and death.&nbsp; Does your average overweight 
		American woman have any will whatsoever to do something difficult and messy like trench warfare?<img alt="Exterminate those slander Islam" src="3.jpg" class="img-float-left">&nbsp; Does she 
		know the basics of creating a stable home?&nbsp; Most women wander off, doing their thing.&nbsp; And so do the children.<br>
		<br>Muslims are experts in enduring suffering, having patience, and pressing on with courage.&nbsp; With the West aborting and contracepting themselves out of existence, Muslims also know that 
		it is only a matter of time before their enemy is permanently weakened, even without jihad.&nbsp; Muslim women bravely have big families and, like the godly women of the Old Testament, take 
		care of and obey their men.<br><br>American feminists are unlikely to rid themselves of their disrespectful and rebellious habits.&nbsp; An Islamic takeover of the U.S. would change that -- 
		and not anything else.<br><br>It takes powerful and large armies of men to occupy entire countries.&nbsp; The Nazis, for example, had to put 500,000 soldiers in Norway during the Second Great 
		War to hold down just 5,000,000 people who wanted nothing to do with the occupation of their country.<br><br>Where is the West going to get the men to do such hard and bloody work if it is 
		required?&nbsp; In places like France and the UK, it is estimated that Muslims will be the majority in 40 years.&nbsp; The average European man and woman do not have enough children 
		<span class="italics">to even maintain</span> their own population while the average Muslim family averages over eight children.<br><br>Who will inherit the earth in the end?&nbsp; How is 
		there any future for a narcissistic, indulgent, untrained, and undisciplined culture like what characterizes the West?&nbsp; How are women going to fight vicious men who are not afraid to die?&nbsp; 
		How will American black men, for example, defend themselves against such superior organized and disciplined forces? 
		<img alt="Islam will dominate the world" src="4.jpg" class="img-float-right"><br><br>
		The scenario is reminiscent of King Hezekiah's dilemma in the early 2nd millennium BC., when Jerusalem was being besieged by the Assyrian army.&nbsp; The Assyrian field commander taunted 
		Hezekiah with these words,</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses–if you can put riders on them! - 2 Kings 18:23</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The commander knew that Jerusalem was a tiny outpost with a small population.&nbsp; How could they withstand the siege by the mighty Assyrians?&nbsp; It would take a miracle....<br><br>
		Unlike the average Western man, Islam thinks globally and in terms of centuries rather than in the context of <span class="italics">"am-I-happy-right-now?"</span> and 
		<span class="italics">"are-all-my-pleasures-and-desires-being-met?"</span>&nbsp; These paradigms, as history repeatedly demonstrates, yield no enduring foundation upon which to build a 
		civilization.</p>
		<h2>How America is at war with Islam</h2>
		<p>Below are some excerpts from an
		<a href="military-strategy-of-global-jihad.pdf">essay</a> written by Sarah E. Zabel of the U.S. Army.&nbsp; While her opinions are not official, they do represent what appears to be a broadly 
		accepted view by the United States.&nbsp; Her essay has valuable insights on global jihad and its strategy to destroy the United States – and us, by implication.<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>As the 21st century begins, however, the United States stands as guarantor of world order, an order based on the rule of man instead of God. The essential first step to breaking down 
			this world order is neutralizing the United States, after which they will be able to break down local authorities and build emirates out of the resulting chaos. To some, “neutralize” means 
			causing U.S. destruction or collapse; others are satisfied with weakening or punishing the United States enough that it removes itself from the Muslim world. Destruction of the United 
			States—the invader and occupier of the Muslim world—is also seen as a useful rallying cry to draw support from the Muslim community.<br><br>
			While the West cannot afford to neglect the ungoverned regions of the world, the global jihadis will continue to paint U.S. and Western military involvement in the Muslim world as an 
			invasion.<br><br>
			The global jihadis make clear that creating instability is a key component of their strategy, and the West must play its role in restoring order and mitigating adverse conditions in 
			regions the jihadis would otherwise try to bring under their sole control. Taliban-style rule should not be the only option offered to the victims of anarchy; instead, promoters of 
			democracy should make sure such people have other alternatives, forcing the jihadist vision to compete within an open marketplace of ideas. Finally, America’s declared policy of promoting 
			democracy is problematic as it confronts issues of religion and governance that reach beyond the global jihadis into the much broader Islamist movement. The United States would do better 
			to seek common ground with Islam by emphasizing the core beliefs behind its democratic philosophy: representative government that responds to the people and protects human rights and 
			dignity. The United States must also remember that democracy is no panacea; the phenomenon of increasing radicalization of British Muslim youths shows that even the opportunities offered 
			by life in a modern democratic nation may be insufficient to defeat the idea of jihad.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Let us look at some of these statements she makes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>&nbsp;<span class="italics">"...guarantor of world order"</span></p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>&nbsp;<span class="italics">"...Western military involvement in the Muslim world"</span></p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><span class="italics">"...seek common ground by emphasizing core beliefs behind [our] democratic philosophy"</span></p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>What stable civilization in the world would want oversight by a nation that is in the grip of such political, social, and cultural decay as is the U.S.?&nbsp; The U.S., in the eyes of 
		people with sense, wants to be the guarantor of&nbsp; world disorder.&nbsp; And we have the most terrifying war machines ever invented to do the job.&nbsp; The people of the world can only 
		hope that Americans will, at some point, use these weapons on their own -- something that seems more likely with the passing of each year.<br>
		<img alt="Freedom go to Hell" src="5.jpg" class="img-float-left"><br>What true Muslim does not recognize that America is at war with him, especially in areas of culture and politics?<br><br>If 
		Muslim armies were to swarm over the United States would we not consider it an invasion?&nbsp; American leaders are blind -- by choice -- and think their decayed culture with its crass 
		materialism and widespread immorality is superior to all others: "<span class="italics">Why wouldn't most non-Western people love to have U. S. forces overrunning their nation?"</span>&nbsp; 
		The materialists, the feminists, the adulterers, the homosexuals, the dope addicts, and other criminals in those countries would love U.S. help.<br><br>Seek common ground with Muslims per 
		American core beliefs?&nbsp; What common ground?&nbsp; What Muslim would want a democratic republic over sharia?&nbsp; How could he accept women voting and holding property?&nbsp; What about 
		the detestable vice known as homosexual "marriage"?&nbsp; The abortion holocaust?&nbsp; There is no common ground with Islam (or, for that matter, with the godly Christian).<br><br>But 
		feminists like Miss Zabel rely on words that sound nice.&nbsp; They exhibit hubris in misunderstanding Islam's focused purpose: to dominate by using deadly force.&nbsp; Miss Zabel lives in a 
		dream world created by Western universities dominated by effete intellectual snobs.<br><br>
		Muslims have scant interest in Western style "freedom."&nbsp; For them, it is just a euphemism for anarchy.<br><br>
		Nonetheless, Zabel is accurate in describing how many in the West see the conflict.&nbsp; What she fails to see is that our nation is limited and, like the British Empire after WWI, is 
		slipping into financial ruin, mediocrity, and a widespread and passive attitude toward the responsibilities of good citizenship.&nbsp; It is impossible for a nation to remain strong if the 
		majority of the voters vote their pocketbook, i.e., if voters queue up at the public trough looking for handouts, as most illegal immigrants and blacks do.&nbsp; This is to say nothing of the 
		irreconcilable and bitter divisions that exists in America at this time.<img alt="Europe take some lessons from 9/11" src="6.jpg" class="img-float-right"><br><br>
		Few, including President Obama, have the courage to express the truth that we are at war with Islam.&nbsp; Understandably, such a statement would complicate the role of the U.S. military in 
		Muslim countries.&nbsp; But what does it matter?&nbsp; There is not a mosque anywhere in the world that would not agree that their religion is at war with the West.&nbsp; We have their U. S. 
		beachhead, CAIR (Council on American Islamic Relations), subverting our nation with lies and distortions, all financed by Arab petro-dollars.&nbsp; It is all-out war with the United States -- 
		and one that we will lose.&nbsp; It is just a matter of time.<br><br>
		An exception to this lack of Western courage is the Dutch politician Geert Wilders.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp; He maintains that Islam is out to either convert, kill, or destroy all non-Muslims.&nbsp; 
		Religion of peace?&nbsp; Such a description makes the effeminate Americans feel good, like the "No Guns Allowed" signs posted in front of public schools.<br><br>Wilder's&nbsp; comments and 
		those of other brave men and women, including Brigette Gabriel, have enraged the followers of the false prophet.&nbsp; They, as expected, respond with even more attacks on hapless non-Muslim 
		bystanders, including the recent (2013) murder of some priests and nuns.&nbsp; Peaceful relationships with followers of Islam is impossible.&nbsp; It can be said that the only good Muslim is a 
		bad one and the only bad Muslim is a good one.<br><br>
		Strangely, Western governments have also persecuted those who dare criticize Islam.&nbsp; In fact, this website is blocked in parts of the European Union (as of 2013).&nbsp; Anti-Christian 
		bigots in control of our culture continue to defend naive and shallow worldviews.&nbsp; They can be described as "one-religion-is-not-anymore-true-than-another" and 
		"if-we-are-just-nice-to-everybody-they-will-all-love-us."<br>
		<br>As Wilders and others note, Islam is opposed to freedom of speech, freedom of belief and conscience, and republican government.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, Islam and the U.S. Constitution are 
		incompatible. But so is the current gang running things here -- the Constitution is just a roadblock in their war on the godly, wherever they may be.<br><br>
		In the West, tolerance (a.k.a. "political correctness") is more important than our national security, the health and safety of our fighting men, and the truth.&nbsp;
		<img alt="Europe you will pay 9/11 is on its way" src="7.jpg" width="410" height="273" class="img-float-left"><br><br>
		It is even more important than the soldiers who died at Fort Hood.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; This tragedy is another example of the incompetence, the cowardice, and the self-serving attitude of the 
		current rulers of the United States.&nbsp; American fighting men need to take to heart that their lives and safety are not a priority of the leftist radicals that have been put in government 
		office.<br><br>
		Will we be forced to tolerate worldviews that promote human sacrifice?&nbsp; Suttee?&nbsp; Open polygamy?&nbsp; What if we have some religion that promotes cannibalism?&nbsp; Are we going to 
		permit them to incite people to kill others and then eat them?&nbsp; How does any decent human being have a long term relationship with a cannibal?&nbsp; Perhaps it is possible if they 
		renounce eating other people....&nbsp; How could we have peace and friendship with Soviet and Chinese Communism, Imperial Japan or the Third Reich?&nbsp; As long as any of these are opposed to 
		Christian white men, they have our government's blessing.<br><br>
		The men who murdered the innocent people in the Trade Towers were products of the Koran – they did it in the name of Allah.&nbsp; Has any Muslim organization in the world declared, <span class="italics">
		“These men were false Muslims and worked for Satan"?</span>&nbsp; Did CAIR take any responsibility?&nbsp; Where is the widespread condemnation of the U.K. Muslim demonstrations which photos 
		are depicted in this essay?&nbsp; Tolerance for Islam or any religious or political organization that exhorts its followers to terror and murder is impossible.<br><br>
		Perhaps some more general mayhem promoted by the followers of Mohammed will wake up the world to the dangerous threat to peace that these people are.&nbsp; But Europeans and most Americans are 
		so frightened of Muslims that is not likely to happen.<br><br>Nothing much has changed since the 7th century and now they are about to have atomic weapons.&nbsp; Will these heathen fanatics 
		restrain themselves?&nbsp; They have never done so in the past.<img alt="Be prepared for the real holocaust" src="8.jpg" width="223" height="344" class="img-float-right"><br><br>
		We owe a great debt of gratitude to the Frenchmen&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Martel">Charles Martel</a>, the Duke and Prince of the Franks.&nbsp; It was he who stopped Islam 
		from marching through Europe when he beat them back at the Battle of Tours in A.D. 732.&nbsp; Martel was simply protecting his nation from being destroyed by bloody terrorists.&nbsp; This was 
		a proper and godly response by government.&nbsp; What is our government doing to protect us from these people other than caving to their demands and making apologies?<br><br>
		The West is in the midst of economic, cultural, and political collapse.&nbsp; It is hopelessly divided and paralyzed from doing much of anything except chasing primitive tribesmen around in 
		some mountainous desert and persecuting true Christians at home.<br><br>But not all nations are incompetent and passive.&nbsp; For example, in 2002 Israeli agents assassinated Salah Shehadeh, 
		the Hamas mastermind responsible for the mass murder of&nbsp;civilians, including school children.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp; Who in the Muslim world had called for this mass killer to be brought to 
		justice?<br><br>
		Most fail to recognize just how dangerous Islam is to Western freedoms, especially freedom of conscience and speech.&nbsp; Their priests and leaders routinely incite their people to bloody 
		violence against anyone who speaks the truth about their prophet or denounces the massive falsehoods in their holy book, the Koran.&nbsp; What other worldview routinely blows up school buses, 
		crowded hotel lobbies, and buildings full of unsuspecting office workers?&nbsp; Where are the so-called peaceful Muslims?<br><br>
		Those who take the time to study the Koran recognize that violence and mayhem is at the heart of it. What should the response of good government be?&nbsp; As bloodthirsty and subversive, its 
		followers should be politely given the choice to renounce Islam or face jail or deportation.&nbsp; It is simple.<br><br>Failing this, government agents should be placed in every mosque in the 
		nation to carefully monitor their activities and report their finding to the public.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp; Those who engage in subversion of the public order (e.g., calling their followers to 
		mayhem and other sorts of violence) should be deported.&nbsp; In sum, Muslims should be treated like any terrorist organization.<br><br>If no one has the courage to shoot black men while on 
		their violent rampages and looting sprees, how can the authorities do the really hard work?&nbsp; However, the criminal gangs running the show here had no qualms whatever of shooting the white 
		men, women, and children of Waco and Ruby Ridge.&nbsp; They knew that the American press would justify and ignore it.&nbsp; But not all have not forgotten these slaughters authorized by 
		Democrats.<br>
		<img alt="death to infidels" src="9.jpg" class="img-float-left">Their mosques here should undergo the same fate as do Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, and Hindu places of worship in lands 
		conquered by this religion: destruction in one way or another.&nbsp; Sadly, a proper response to these people is unlikely to happen in the climate of moral paralysis and decline such as we 
		have in the West and, particularly, in the United States.&nbsp; People like the President and those in the judiciary and Congress lack the moral courage to address this issue (or any serious 
		issue, for that matter).&nbsp; They are too happy to leave this malignant cancer to future generations.&nbsp; Make no mistake: Islam will be addressed at some time in the future.<br><br>We 
		will all be speaking Arabic or there will be a flood of violence as non-Muslims defend themselves from these cutthroats.</p>
		<h2>How the Creator of the Heavens and the Earth May See It<br>
		</h2>
		<p>I have suggested that Islam is a terror organization masquerading as a religion and is bent on using any means possible to conquer the world. Others have described it as tribalism on 
		steroids.&nbsp; In any case, its violence can be terrifying.&nbsp; As someone once noted, every place where Islam is established, that nation has bloody borders.&nbsp; There is no Islamic 
		nation in the world where non-Muslims are free to teach what they see as the truth or worship – openly.<br><br>
		Generally, it is best described as monotheistic heathenism which adopts aspects of Judaism.&nbsp; It is full of countless distortions of the teachings and history of the Bible.&nbsp; It 
		ascribes to the notion that men can be sinless and that various works (known as the Five Pillars) will suffice to please their god Allah who will allow them into a paradise full of young women 
		and beautiful gardens.&nbsp; The Koran gives extensive instructions on how to deal with those who oppose Islam.&nbsp; Generally, mutilate, torture, and kill them.&nbsp; Women are little more 
		than cows that can be abandoned at will.&nbsp; Your wife here is sulky?&nbsp; Beat her with a rod!&nbsp; Those who die in the defense of Islam are instantly promoted to a worldly and sensuous 
		paradise.&nbsp; "Kill the infidels, die, and then spend eternity in a garden having sex with young women."<br><br>
		But who is Allah?&nbsp; What is their paradise?&nbsp; This god indulges its followers in: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>Bloody vengeance on its enemies</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>A paradise full of women for the convenience of men</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>Man's evil pride and stubbornness.</p>
			</li></ul>
		<p>Such a god cannot be the One mentioned in Genesis.&nbsp; He is certainly not the One who made the heavens and the earth and who revealed Himself to the Patriarchs.&nbsp; In this respect, 
		Mohammed made a grave error or his followers misquoted him<br><br>
		Islamic apologists who assert that the United States is the Great Satan give too much credit to the ordinary folly, vice, and sin that have overcome the people here.<br><br>Nonetheless, Islam 
		could not have maintained its stranglehold on so many nations over the centuries if it did not have some biblical truth in its message.&nbsp; What a blessing if a Koran could be found that 
		contained the truth about God and that Mohammed had originally echoed the truth of Scripture rather than what we currently have.&nbsp; But then what use would the Koran be as we already have 
		the Bible?<br><br>
		Such important attributes as self sacrifice, generosity to the poor, the absence of crass idolatry, truthfulness, sobriety, the suppression of homosexuality, adultery, and thievery ensure that 
		this worldview did not quickly undermine itself.<br><br>
		But the Prophets of the Bible are clear:&nbsp;God has only spoken eternal truth to the Jews.&nbsp; The rest of us only echo what they heard.&nbsp; He has proven this with great miracles and power – 
		with many eye witnesses.<br><br>
		A further proof that Islamic descriptions of God are in error is Allah's mode of operation in the world:&nbsp; His arm is too short.&nbsp; In fact, he does not even have an arm.&nbsp; The 
		result is that he must incite his followers to violence against their supposed enemies.&nbsp; The True Creator of all does not need&nbsp;gangs of cutthroats to do his bidding.&nbsp; He can do it 
		himself.&nbsp; On the other hand, He can also use them for His holy purposes – as He has repeatedly done before, including the most violent attacks against His people, the Jews.&nbsp;
		<br><br>
		As the Scriptures teach, the LORD alone wins the battle – and this with His people often standing by.&nbsp; This is done with the express purpose that a man may not look upon what he has done 
		and say, "My hands did this."<br><br>
		American leftists and feminized men are terrified of Islam and falsely believe that these people are violent as a result of our actions.&nbsp; (One could suppose this to be true if our actions 
		were merely being born a non-Muslim.)<br><br>
		We who claim to love and serve the Creator can be content that He will protect us from the merciless violence of Muslims.&nbsp; Even if He does not, we must not agree with them that their 
		worldview is either true or good.&nbsp; For us, it is an exercise of faith that is much like what the men of Daniel's time had to endure.&nbsp; 
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>But even if he does not [deliver us], we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up. - Daniel 3:18</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>So, in the end, no godly man can submit to Allah.&nbsp; It is a great comfort to know that our God can deliver us from the gods of this world, including Allah.</p>
		<h2>The Role of Islam in the World</h2>
		<p>Too many who call themselves Christians are functionally deistic and this should not be.&nbsp; God acts upon the world at all times and has not abandoned it.<br><br>Could today's Muslims be 
		the Chaldeans of the 6th century B.C. who were sent by God to punish wickedness?&nbsp; The Prophets repeatedly warned God's people that their spiritual and physical adultery and idolatry would 
		have dire consequences.&nbsp; The Bible and history are replete with examples, including the fall of Rome and Constantinople.<br><br>
		The Prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel repeatedly warned Israel during the time of Nebuchadnezzar that to resist their oppressors would be resisting God Himself.<br><br>
		It is, therefore, possible that the dramatic rise of the power and glory of Islam has been the work of God for a similar purpose:&nbsp;to judge wickedness in the West?&nbsp; Are we now in the 
		position of opposing the Creator's plan to punish wickedness here at home?&nbsp; Hopefully, not.&nbsp; The Jewish leaders of Jesus' time faced such a quandary.&nbsp; Gamaliel warned the 
		Sanhedrin to leave the Apostles alone. If their preaching was of man's origin it would fail or ...<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>"... if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God."</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Who succeeds fighting against God?&nbsp; The United States puts great trust in military technology but, as we are finding out in Afghanistan, more than clever weapons are needed to defeat 
		an enemy.&nbsp; What will happen when the Chinese or the Russians invent a handheld convenient weapon that effectively disables drones and the missiles they fire?</p>
		<h2>What are Christians to Do?</h2>
		<p>It's a grim picture for the West.&nbsp; What does it all mean?&nbsp; In particular, how should faithful Christians face this threat?&nbsp; There is little we can do as people who have no 
		representation in government.<br><br>Like Jeremiah and the Prophets, we must remain calm and be mindful that these great events are part of an overall plan that is unknown to us.&nbsp; 
		Christians can be faithful.&nbsp; We can remember that we are not abandoned as orphans by the God who promises to save us.&nbsp; At some time, His fury will arise against His enemies here -- 
		most of the human race.<br><br>
		Our purpose as Christians is first to be obedient to the Gospel: to live loving and holy lives in peace with all men, in so far as it is possible.&nbsp; We are to rejoice always while giving 
		thanks to God in all circumstances.&nbsp; It means minding our own business.<br><br>When the Prophets speak of us being "light," they were not referring to American mass-marketing programs 
		that gets as many people as possible to say, "I love Jesus."&nbsp; It refers, instead, to the light that is demonstrated by our conduct (Philippians 2:15), especially a life known for its love 
		of others.<br><br>
		We may have to endure suffering, something inevitable when the Gospel meets the world (1 Pet. 2,4).&nbsp; Men hate the fact that they are sinners by nature and without hope in this world.&nbsp; 
		Christians must peacefully yet firmly resist the world and its evil.&nbsp; We can explain why:&nbsp;the Creator sent His Son as a sacrifice for sin and only by faith in Him is there reconciliation 
		and forgiveness, not through any work of man.<br><br>
		We are commanded to love the LORD who saved us (the first of the Royal Commandments) and love our neighbors (do good to them – the second).&nbsp; We are not to do it by proxy.&nbsp; Wherever 
		in the world we are, however small a place, we can guard our hearts and eyes and do good to others.<br><br>It is a personal witness that we love God with all of our heart, souls, and minds and 
		our neighbor as ourselves.&nbsp; We are never to fear anyone, including Muslims, but, instead, do good to them as individual Christians.&nbsp; However, Jesus did not command us to submit to 
		personal violence from lawless men (Luke 22:36).&nbsp; In this respect we can assist the magistrate in suppressing evil.&nbsp; We should not forget Jesus' words,</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>But I tell you: love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain 
			on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your brothers, what are 
			you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect. - Matthew 5:44-48</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Hopefully, having to suffer sharia is not what is in store and I am also completely wrong about Muslims being the modern&nbsp;Chaldeans.&nbsp; But will the people in the West wake up in time and 
		repent of their evil to avert what appears to be the Divine Judgment through Islam?<br><br>Is it some trial to teach us, contrary to the belief of most in this country, that money, luxury, and 
		sensory indulgence are not ends in themselves?<br><br>
		Will the West perish on the altar of free speech?&nbsp; Foolish rulings by the Supreme Court (like the flag burning case) indicates that this may be so.&nbsp; Is it engrained in&nbsp;some (the 
		cultural ruling elite) that it is better to have no country at all rather than fail to force their worldview on everyone else?<br><br>
		The good news is that it is not up to the Church to decide what the government should do.&nbsp; It is not our job.&nbsp; Accordingly, we should pray for our President to have godly wisdom, 
		courage, and the greatest care in protecting us from dangerous enemies.&nbsp; He is doing the opposite.&nbsp; It is ironic that the current ruler labels a large number of Americans "enemies."<br><br>
		If Islam's jihad against the world is of man, it will fail.&nbsp; If it is a judgment from God, then resisting it will put us in the position of fighting against God.&nbsp; If you are an 
		American soldier, do you want to fight against God?<br><br>Thankfully, Jesus Christ promised that nothing would prevail against the Church.&nbsp; If this were not so, we would have much to be 
		concerned about.&nbsp; Meanwhile, show love and concern to Muslims you know or meet, as hard as that may seem to be.&nbsp; Help them whenever possible.&nbsp; If it helps, remember these words 
		from Scripture,</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>For if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!&nbsp; – Rom. 5:10<br><br>
			For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the 
			heavenly realms.&nbsp; – Eph. 6:12</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Be blessed richly.</p>
