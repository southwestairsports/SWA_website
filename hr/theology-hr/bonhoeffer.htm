	<p>by Hadley Robinson</p>
	
	
		<blockquote>
			“Bonhoeffer, however, understood the proper roles of the church and the state.” – <a href="http://www.standfirminfaith.com/?/sf/page/29345">Sarah Hey</a></blockquote>
		He did—sort of.&nbsp; If Mr. Bonhoeffer had considered Romans 13, Daniel 4:32ff, Titus 3:1,2, among others, perhaps he likely would not have been part of the plot to assassinate Mr. Hitler—for 
		which he was subsequently executed.&nbsp; It was a tragedy as well as understandable.&nbsp; Could Mr. Hitler have been God’s man for that time?&nbsp; What are the consequences for second-guessing the 
		Creator's appointments of civil leaders who are little more than the heads of criminal gangs?&nbsp; How evil does a leader have to be before citizens should band together in an attempt to take him 
		out?&nbsp; It is an in-house debate and godly men, including Mr. Bonhoeffer, have come to different conclusions.&nbsp; <br><br>This is not to deny or belittle Mr. Bonhoeffer's contributions and defense 
		of the Church during those difficult years.&nbsp; His character was exemplary as a Christian man.&nbsp; His devotion to the Christian faith rarely matched in modern times.<br><br>But his criminal 
		conspiracy against the chief magistrate of the time – and the celebration of his attempt by much of the evangelical church – provides just more fodder for the heathen and the Spiritual Powers 
		to accuse Christians of having more than a passing interest in the kingdoms of this world.&nbsp; It also demonstrates that many in the Church embrace to one degree or another the tenants of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism">
		humanism</a> – a non-Christian worldview.<br><br>Thanks to Mr. Bonhoeffer and many others, we are often viewed by the heathen as busybodies, meddlers, seditionists, traitors, and conspirators 
		against the State.&nbsp; As a consequence, governments are suspicious of Christians and carefully watched.&nbsp; Should Christians encourage such opinions?&nbsp; We are not to please outsiders generally but 
		we are required to do our best not to have the Name of Christ slandered because of our actions (1Pet. 2:12; 4:15).<br><br>To suggest that God is the sole authority who appoints heads of state 
		is unwelcome among humanists and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism">Deists</a> within the Church.&nbsp; Locke’s dismissal of Romans 13 on the grounds that a bad magistrate (in our 
		opinion) is no magistrate at all (and we are free to do to him anything we like) is a Protestant tradition of the Mk. 7:9 variety.&nbsp; Rebellion against the magistrate no matter how bad or 
		disliked is prohibited by teaching in the New Testament.&nbsp; Such monsters as Hazael (2Ki. 8) and Nebuchadnezzar (Jer. 21) were God’s men for a task—bloody and horrible.&nbsp; Those who opposed them 
		opposed God.<br><br>Why, then, consider Mr. Bonhoeffer as an example for Christians per our relations with the state?&nbsp; Better would be another German pastor of that time, 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Schneider_(pastor)">Paul Schneider</a>.&nbsp; Then there is <a href="franz-kaufmann.pdf">Franz Kaufmann</a>.&nbsp; They were Christian heroes who resisted 
		armed revolution/sedition yet made it clear that the Third Reich was of the Devil.<br><br>A good question would be, “What would pastor Schneider do?”&nbsp; He did what Jesus, Paul, Shadrach, 
		Stephen, Zechariah, Joseph of Egypt, and countless others did—faithfully testify to the Gospel of Christ by word and deed.&nbsp; They were men with godly backbone.&nbsp; None of them 
		<a href="2ndcommandment.htm">took up arms</a> or conspired against God’s anointed whether good, mediocre, or horrible.&nbsp; Whatever happened to Isaiah 54:16?&nbsp; Many aspects of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcionism">
		Marcionism</a> are firmly entrenched in the evangelical church—but no one seems to care.<br><br>Suffice it to say, would I resist the urge to eliminate some criminal posing as a leader of a 
		country?&nbsp; Christians have been deeply divided since the beginning of the Church over this issue.&nbsp; As with Mr. Bonhoeffer, if we take up the sword, we face the prospect of dying by it.&nbsp; Would 
		God consider something as this a noble deed?&nbsp; Or, would we an assassin?&nbsp;&nbsp; It is far better to error on the side of caution and consider the great men of the Bible as our examples.&nbsp; King Saul 
		was a criminal in the end and the godly David did not raise up his hand against him.&nbsp; This is something to consider.&nbsp; King Saul received justice but maybe not as soon as either he or David 
		would have like.</div>
