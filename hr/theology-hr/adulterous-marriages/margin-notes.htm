		This preposition (ei) changed the phrase from "sexual uncleanness not withstanding" to "except for sexual uncleanness," meanings which are nearly opposite.<br><br>The Latin clearly says 
		"except for sexual uncleanness."&nbsp; Discoveries of very ancient Greek texts in the 19th century all reveal that "ei" was a later addition to the Sacred Text, apparently to agree with the 
		Vulgate.<br><br>Why modern scholars make no note of this is a mystery. However, if they did, it might require modern translations to be changed.&nbsp; This could have seismic effects on Protestant 
		doctrines concerning marriage.<br><br>Reformers like Erasmus were intent on finding some way to allow for the dissolution of marriages, especially for adultery.&nbsp; Adding the Greek preposition 
		"ei" at the front of the phrase would be just the way to nullify or make confusing every other teaching about the permanency of marriage in the Bible.&nbsp; How does one dissolve a father-son 
		relationship?&nbsp; No matter what a son does, he is always a son.&nbsp; The bond between a man and his wife is stronger than the father-son bond.&nbsp; How can the lesser bond be indissoluble but not the 
		greater?&nbsp; It makes no sense – but not if one's heart is hard.
