	<p>by Hadley Robinson</p>
	
		<blockquote>
			Look at the legalized adultery we call divorce. Men marry one wife after another and are still admitted into good society; and women do likewise. There are thousands of supposedly 
			respectable men in America living with other men’s wives, and thousands of supposedly respectable women living with other women’s husbands. —R. A. Torrey 1856-1928<br>
		</blockquote>
		
		<h2>Preface</h2>
		<p>The purpose of this essay is to reestablish these ancient but now disregarded truths from Scripture:<br>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Men who abandon the wives of their youth, for whatever reason, are guilty of treachery because they have broken their vows and perjured themselves.</li>
			<li>Nothing dissolves a marriage but death but even then there are still binding ties of the living with the dead.</li>
			<li>All remarriage after divorce<sup>1</sup> is adulterous.</li>
			<li>A man who has remarried after divorce is, by definition, not a one-woman man and cannot serve in leadership roles in the Church including teaching others.</li>			<li>Those who 
			are joined in an adulterous relationship continue in a state of adultery until they cease having sexual relations.</li>
			<li>The widespread and long running decline of Christian orthodoxy in the West is likely a result of God's judgment on sexual immorality being accepted within the Church.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Since the earliest times, men have sought to justify their adulteries.&nbsp; What is particularly egregious are their schemes to distort the broad teaching of the Word of God in order to 
		justify evil.&nbsp; The evidence of this is widespread and can be found everywhere across many centuries, even in the Early Church.&nbsp; Humanism teaches that man's happiness is more 
		important than obedience to God.&nbsp; This worldview and its proponents have been allowed to greatly influence Christian orthodoxy, even before the period of the Reformation.&nbsp; Few know 
		that Erasmus, a great scholar during this period and a Humanist, had broad influence on many doctrines developed during that time, especially through the Greek text he published that was used 
		by translators of the Bible.</p>
		<p>It is with the greatest regret that this author, for at least two decades, supported the notion that marriage is not permanent in this life.&nbsp; Rather than carefully study the Sacred 
		Text and consider the unanimous statements written in blood by the Church Fathers and many others, he chose to believe the multitude of professors in seminaries and the pastors of the churches 
		he attended.&nbsp; The author's wife, on the other hand, has been steadfast in this matter since the beginning – regardless of what others would teach or say.</p>
		<p>What changed this writer's mind?&nbsp; Being forced to look at the Greek texts, the historical teaching of the Church, works by heathen scholars on Greco-Roman culture, and the book
		<span class="italics">Jesus and Divorce</span>, an exhaustive reference work written by Gordon Wenham and William Heth.&nbsp; This is to say nothing of the work of the Holy Spirit in 
		convicting the author of the sin of adultery.&nbsp; Thankfully, this author has not succumbed to the evil spirit of this age by abandoning the wife of his youth, as so many have.<br>
		</p>
		<p>We should not be surprised at the deadly peril that one is in if he publicly expresses any or all of the six points above.&nbsp; Since the Creation, we men have sought to justify our sin.&nbsp; 
		Our schemes are endless, the variety boundless.&nbsp; Translators continue to deliver English text that may be technically accurate but makes little or no sense in the context of the passage, 
		especially Jesus' teaching on divorce in Matthew 19.</p>
		<p>Because of a deliberately altered Greek text, the translators of the KJV contributed to the unnecessary confusion surrounding Christ's teaching on marriage.&nbsp; We have, in some important 
		ways, Holy Scripture in English and other languages that is not reliable.</p>
		<p>We need to always remind ourselves that translations of the Bible are a product of some committee of sinful men, both Christian and not, including those who may have desperately wanted to 
		abandon a marriage and start over or who had already done so.&nbsp; Or, they may have desired to teach others the same.&nbsp; The writer of this essay had otherwise brilliant seminary 
		professors like that.</p>
		<p>If the writer of this essay was not married to a godly Christian woman but, instead, to some ambitious shrew with wandering eyes, would his opinions on this matter be different?&nbsp; Who 
		can say unless our God preserves us from such a calamity?&nbsp; Hopefully not – and may the Creator deal with us, be it ever so severely, if we ever violate our oaths to God and to the wives 
		of our youth.</p>
		<p>It is with sadness that most men in the church do not keep their oaths and their pastors are too happy to indulge the perjuries of these faithless men.</p>
		<p>We should be alarmed.</p>
		<p>Until 100 years ago, divorce was a terrible stigma.&nbsp; Decent Christian people had nothing to do with it.&nbsp; Now, divorce is a common event in the lives of those who claim to be 
		Christian.<br></p>
		<p>In the godless environment in which we find ourselves, it is so easy to do – and encouraged by the worst civil government in our history.&nbsp; The surrounding culture loves adultery and 
		every other form of immorality and lewd conduct.&nbsp; If one lives in the United States, he is living in the most immoral country that has likely ever existed.</p>
		<p>However, the Creator of the Heavens and the earth hates the treachery committed by faithless men and women against their spouses.&nbsp; Adultery and idolatry are tightly wound together 
		throughout Scripture as genetic material is wound together in the DNA double helix.&nbsp; What will these people have to say at the Judgment to a furious Creator who has sworn that He will 
		unleash justice without mercy upon the unrepentant and the unbelieving?</p>
		<p>There are Christian brothers who have remained chaste and faithful to wives who have abandoned them for other men.&nbsp; Their faith and obedience are exemplary.</p>
		<p>Church leadership in the 21st century has abetted this marital holocaust by accommodating the depraved values of the culture in which we live.&nbsp; They have abandoned the doctrine of 
		marriage given by God in the Scriptures and affirmed by the Church for thousands of years.&nbsp; Just because this leadership is virtually unanimous in its opinions, it does not follow that 
		their teaching is also godly.&nbsp; There is no democracy of theology, no majority opinion that decides biblical truth.<br></p>
		<p>R. C. Sproul once said, <em>"Christian orthodoxy is challenged in every generation."</em>&nbsp; It was challenged when the Church was barely born and it is challenged today -- right where 
		we live.</p>
		<p>In particular, the heresy known as
		<a href="../antinomianism.htm">antinomianism</a> is gaining as many adherents as the Reich Church did among the Germans of the early 1930's.&nbsp; Humanism's influence on church doctrine has 
		only become stronger since the Reformation period.&nbsp; It is all alarming and indicates that we may be plunging into a New Dark Age as the Christian faith becomes more disconnected and 
		isolated from the biblical doctrine of personal holiness, <span class="italics">"My sins are forgiven in Christ past, present, and future.&nbsp; As a Christian, it no longer matters what I 
		do." </span> &nbsp;God's holiness and righteousness have been largely abandoned outside official doctrine.</p>
		<p>In sum, <span class="italics">"let us sin all the more so that grace will abound all the more."</span>&nbsp; There is little concern for what the Bible teaches.&nbsp; What pastor of today 
		struggles to learn for himself what God's Word has to say?&nbsp; Most just browse in the bookstores for the latest opinions of others, joining the herd of opinion.</p>
		<p>How do smart and educated men hold to and teach doctrines that are contrary to the collective teaching of Scripture and to historic Christian orthodoxy?&nbsp; We need look no further than 
		to some false doctrines established during the Reformation and to men's fear of the unrepentant ungodly, immoral, and adulterous in their own churches.&nbsp; As is also with the spiritually 
		dull or blind and the willfully ignorant, everyone wants it both ways: indulge in sin and have the blessing of God.</p>
		<p>The catastrophe in the German church during the 1930's demonstrated that about 10% of pastors and churches remained faithful to Christ when the chips were down.</p>
		<p>So, my dear pastor, which percentage group are you among?&nbsp; Do you have the stomach to oppose a Herod or a Herodias?&nbsp; Would you rather lose your job than give in to evil?</p>
		<p>While we do not yet have fascists kidnapping faithful Christians and throwing them into concentration camps, we do have bitterly hostile leadership that controls the important institutions 
		of American culture, education, and government.&nbsp; They are doing everything they can to oppose God and persecute His chosen people.&nbsp; The chips are down....</p>
		<p>Are only 10% of professing Christians Spirit-filled people who have been converted by the Holy Spirit?&nbsp; How does one make such an assessment, if the German church during the Nazi era 
		is not typical?&nbsp; Pollster <a href="http://www.barna.org/">George Barna</a> noted recently that the figures may be grimmer: only about 5% of people who profess to be Christians believe the 
		essentials of the faith, such as the virgin birth. If these figures are considerably in error, the numbers are still but a fraction.&nbsp; This gives rise to the certainty that we are 
		surrounded in the church with people whose names are not written in the Book of Life.&nbsp; Could these grim figures also be extended back to the 1500's?&nbsp; If there were triple the number 
		of converted men in the visible church, it would still be a small number.</p>
		<p>Reading contemporary American evangelical Protestant works on marriage is an exercise in monotony.&nbsp; As is typical of an ingrown institution, the authors read each other's works and 
		rarely venture outside the framework in which they find themselves.&nbsp; The Pharisees were also like this.&nbsp; R. A. Torrey perceived the signs of the time but do the pastors of today?&nbsp; 
		What has changed?&nbsp; God's word? Popular opinion?</p>
		<p>Is there any anchor left in this world upon which a Christian can safely depend?<br></p>
		<p>To investigate the misuse of Scripture, the errors in translations, the bias that most Reformers shared towards marriage and divorce, to bring to light the tinkering with the Greek Text 
		that scholars of that period engaged in are all irrelevant and uninteresting to the typical American evangelical.</p>
		<p>Consistent and careful scholarship by popular authors and teachers has a rare place in our church culture.&nbsp; This is true of well known leaders, including Billy Graham, James Dobson, 
		and Bill Bright.&nbsp; Because of their influence, they get a free pass from scrutiny.&nbsp; If everyone thinks they are great – they must be and God forbid if one criticizes their theological 
		views however full of holes and errors they may be.<br></p>
		<p>What is unfathomable in these times is that celibacy may be the only godly option for those who have had their marriages devastated by adultery.&nbsp; It begs the question: when did Jesus 
		suggest that a Christian might have to endure a lifetime of suffering for His Name's sake?&nbsp; According to the near unanimous opinion of American Evangelicals, the answer is He never 
		did....&nbsp; On the other hand, the Lord said,</p>
		<blockquote>...If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. -- Luke 9:23</blockquote>
		<p>Contemporary western Christianity of all flavors is fraught with the paradigm, "What's in it for me?" or "What kind of experience can I have?"&nbsp; On the brighter side, there are a few 
		Evangelical theologians, including
		<a href="http://www.amazon.com/No-Place-Truth-Whatever-Evangelical/dp/080280747X">
		David F. Wells</a> and <a href="http://www.ligonier.org/">R. C. Sproul</a>, who have expressed alarm at the crisis in Western Christianity which is characterized by the wholesale disregard for 
		biblical truth.<br></p>
		<p>Who asks the question <span class="italics">"Can God, my Savior, take me through the deep valleys as I walk by faith instead of by sight?"</span></p>
		<p>Like John the Baptist, we can still lose our heads for opposing sins like adultery.&nbsp; Generally, godly Christians often run afoul of the world for the same reason that Jesus did,<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>The world ... hates me because I testify that what it does is evil.&nbsp; Jn. 7:7</blockquote>		
		<p>Is there any prospective marriage these days which would be considered adulterous by the vast majority of church leadership?<sup>2</sup></p>
		<p>The Apostolic Church and the Church Fathers were not confused about what constituted adultery.</p>
		<p>The Baptist was murdered because he called Herodias and Herod adulterers. Neither of these two were repentant of what they had done, as was King David (Ps. 51).&nbsp; David's response is 
		rare.&nbsp; In fact, in his 40+ years in the Church the writer of this essay has never heard anyone repent of adultery.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it is to God's glory and our salvation and comfort 
		that the Blood of Christ can cleanse the repentant from any sin, including adultery.</p>
		<p>Nonetheless, there are always consequences of sin in both this life and the next.&nbsp; This is why repentance is tantamount to faith.&nbsp; Not only does one do an about-face but he must 
		also do whatever he can to remedy the consequences of his sin.&nbsp; In some instances, it can be costly.</p>
		<blockquote>
			Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, for John had been saying to him: "It is not lawful for you to have her." 
			Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people, because they considered him a prophet. Mt 14:3-5</blockquote>
		<p>Why was it unlawful for Herod to have Herodias? This question is rarely discussed because if it were, there would be many in the Church who would have to quit adulterous unions.&nbsp; Not 
		only are there errors in church tradition concerning illegal unions but the actual meaning of the words used in the New Testament for adultery and divorce have some differences from their 
		meaning in the original languages of the Sacred Text.</p>
		<p>How does one repent of adultery?</p>
		<p>If a man steals 100 gold coins from a neighbor, is discovered, and tells the magistrate and the lawful owner of the gold, "<span class="italics">I'm sorry</span>," is that the end of the 
		matter?&nbsp; Can he say, like so many, "<span class="italics">Jesus paid the penalty for my sins past, present, and future so all is well.&nbsp; Let grace abound!</span>"</p>
		<p>Even heathen magistrates would, generally, agree that this is not justice but there is no consensus among evangelical Protestants concerning this matter.&nbsp; It is even more difficult for 
		the latter to address adultery in a coherent biblical manner.</p>
		<p>What is the thief to do?&nbsp; According to Scripture, there must be repentance.&nbsp; But what is it?&nbsp; Today's typical evangelical author get writer's cramp or becomes tongue-tied at 
		the mention of the word.&nbsp; On the other hand, Scripture is clear:&nbsp; repentance is not only a change of heart but also requires action.</p>
		<p>The thief must repent of his thievery which means a.) he confesses it was wrong and b.) he must make restitution.&nbsp; But there is more: c.) he must face the consequences of his actions 
		before a judge.</p>
		<p>In the typical church, the thief might be required to acknowledge his sin but anything more than this is doubtful.</p>
		<p>With the matter of adultery -- one of the most grievous sins there is in God's sight -- the church has little or no response.&nbsp; Pastors who do mention it do so on tiptoe and apologize 
		profusely for the statements in the Word of God.</p>
		<p>Adultery is the stealing of someone else's wife or husband.&nbsp; How is one to repent of it?&nbsp; It must require godly sorrow, a cessation of the sin, and restitution.&nbsp; How is 
		restitution made?&nbsp; However, Scripture declares that restitution for things like adultery and murder are impossible.&nbsp; The thief can return the gold but how does a man "return" another 
		man's wife with whom he has had sexual relations?</p>
		<blockquote>But a man who commits adultery lacks judgment; whoever does so destroys himself.&nbsp; Blows and disgrace are his lot, and his shame will never be wiped away; for jealousy arouses a 
			husband's fury, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.&nbsp; He will not accept any compensation; he will refuse the bribe, however great it is. -- Prov. 6:32-35</blockquote>
		<p>Despite the fury of an offended husband, Scripture teaches that the blood of Christ can cleanse the guilt of any sin.&nbsp; However, such grace can only be acquired by the man who repents, 
		the man who has been convicted of his sin by the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; Nonetheless, this man, like the murderer, may face the death penalty as proscribed in the Mosaic law and in most cultures 
		since the beginning of time.&nbsp; The great Princeton theologian, Charles Hodge, noted in the late 1800's that there was not a jury in America that would convict a jealous husband of 
		murdering his wife's lover -- a sad testament to R. A. Torrey's observation of the seismic shift in the culture towards wickedness.</p>
		<p>If the thief must cease his stealing, so the adulterer must cease his adulteries.&nbsp; This is what the Church taught for over a thousand years -- until the Reformation came along and 
		provided a legal fiction that gave adulterers the green-light to continue in their sin.&nbsp; <br><br>No doubt most of the Reformers noted what happened to John the Baptist and preferred the 
		wrath of Man to that of God.&nbsp; If pastors were obedient to God in this matter of adultery, they would have to empty half of their congregations because that would be the approximate number 
		of people who would insist on continuing in their adulteries.</p>
		<p>A happy thought is that these pastors would unlikely be murdered for their obedience....</p>
		<h2>I.&nbsp; The Marriage Union<br></h2>
		<blockquote>For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh. – Gen. 2:24</blockquote>
		<p>
		<span class="strong">"united"</span>&nbsp;– The bond between a man and his wife is stronger than any other except our bond to God.&nbsp; The English word "unite" or "join" lacks the strength of the 
		Hebrew verb (DBQ) used in the text.&nbsp; A better rendering which reflects its use throughout the Old Testament would be to "hold fast in undeviating loyalty".</p>
		<p>An example that demonstrates the intense meaning of DBQ is in Psalm 63:8 (translated here as "cling").<br>		
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me.</blockquote>
		<p>The psalm is a hymn of David's holding fast to his God.&nbsp; In the same way a man should hold fast – in undeviating loyalty – to his wife (Eph. 5:25).</p>
		<p>The most outstanding example in Scripture of DBQ is in Ruth 1:14-17 where it is translated "clung", probably the closed word we have in English to the Hebrew.</p>
		<blockquote>
			Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-by, but Ruth clung to her.&nbsp; "Look," said Naomi, "your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her."&nbsp; But Ruth replied, 
			"Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die, 
			and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me."</blockquote>
		<p><span class="strong">"one flesh"</span>&nbsp;– The relationship between the man and the woman is like that of a brother and sister but more so.&nbsp; This is the biblical meaning of becoming one 
		flesh.&nbsp; It is not a reference to their physical union as the vast majority of American pastors believe.</p>
		<p>If a wife is bonded to her husband more than he is to his own sister, if her bond to him exceeds the man's bond to his father and mother, and – in sum – if his bond to his woman exceeds 
		every other earthly bond, how can it be broken?&nbsp; A man's sister is always his sister, whatever she might do – so is a man's wife always his wife, regardless.</p>
		<blockquote>There is no such thing as an ex-wife in God's Creation.&nbsp; That this paradigm has crept into the language of the Church is another example of Satan's hold on one of our most sacred 
			institutions.</blockquote>
		<p>Examples of the correct meaning of flesh are found in Gen 29:14 and Gen 37:27.&nbsp; Scripture does not support the view that the sexual union of a man and woman makes them married.&nbsp; 
		Sexual union completes the marriage but does not establish it.&nbsp; An example of this is the rape of Dinah in Gen.34:1-4:</p>
		<blockquote>Now Dinah, the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the women of the land.&nbsp; When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of that area, saw her, he took her and 
			violated her.&nbsp; His heart was drawn to Dinah daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke tenderly to her.&nbsp; And Shechem said to his father Hamor, "Get me this girl as my wife."
		</blockquote>
		<p>Why would Shechem want to marry Dinah if she was already his wife?&nbsp; That is, sexual union does not make two people married to each other.&nbsp; With regards to Dinah becoming defiled 
		(Gen. 34:5), she, a virgin, was not defiled by the rape itself but by the fact that the perpetrator was not a Hebrew (Dt. 7:23; 22:28).<br></p>
		<p>Under the Law, a man who raped an un-betrothed virgin had to marry her, if he paid the bride price and the father approved.&nbsp; The penalty was not death.</p>
		<p>Another example of the mistaken meaning of becoming one flesh is seen in Mt. 1:18-19.&nbsp; Joseph is explicitly described as Mary's husband before he had any physical union with her.&nbsp; 
		If there were no marriage between them, Joseph would not have had to put her away (Mt 1:19).&nbsp; 1 Cor. 6:16-17 is often misused to support the notion that physical union establishes the 
		marital union.<sup>3</sup></p>
		<p>The Hebrew meanings of both becoming one flesh and being united establish a superior strength and permanence of the marriage bond that is only paralleled in Scripture by God's covenant with 
		His people.&nbsp; No other bond in Creation has this quality or durability, including the blood relation between a father and his son.<sup>4</sup></p>
		<p>It follows that the modern definition of divorce contains inventions.&nbsp; Any subsequent remarriage is adulterous, just as Jesus taught (Mk. 10:11).&nbsp; But unrepentant, adulterous 
		teachers have done everything they can to make the teaching of divorce in Scripture as confusing as possible so they can flatter sinners and fill the churches.</p>
		<h2>II.&nbsp; Acting Treacherously</h2>
		<blockquote>
			...the LORD has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant. – Mal. 2:14 NASB</blockquote>
		<p>The man who abandons the bride of his youth has committed treachery against her (KJV, NASB, NIV "break faith").&nbsp; It is a premeditated malicious desertion.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp; There is no 
		teaching in Scripture which either explicitly or implicitly suggests that the desertion of a wife does not cease to be treacherous even if she is guilty of sexual misconduct.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp; 
		The marriage covenant is broken by nothing except death (Rom. 7:1-3 et al).</p>
		<p>Why, then, do the NIV and some other translations weaken the sense of the evil action done here in Malachi but, on the other hand, keep the correct sense elsewhere, such as in Ps. 73:15?&nbsp; 
		One can only guess.&nbsp; Men who have acted treacherously, including translators, do not want their actions described as such so they go easy....</p>
		<p>Who has not acted faithlessly in a weak moment?&nbsp; Has anyone not taken matters into his own hands and, in a word, denied God's sovereignty over His creation?&nbsp; But if one behaves 
		treacherously against his wife, it is different because it is <em>premeditated</em>.&nbsp; It is similar to the difference between manslaughter and murder aforethought.</p>
		<p>According to Jesus, the man who abandons his wife also commits adultery against her (unless she has been immoral).&nbsp; Either way, anyone who marries the wife commits adultery with her.&nbsp; 
		If she remarries, how can she forgive husband #1 if he repents of his sin?&nbsp; Adultery is not an unforgiveable sin.</p>
		<p>How can a man who has dealt treacherously with the wife of his youth be considered above reproach or fit as a leader or teacher in the Church (1Tim. 3:2)?&nbsp; How can one who has taken 
		the wife of another be a godly example to the flock?&nbsp; The Hebrew used in Malachi, Psalm 73, and elsewhere is the strongest word possible for the worst things men do.</p>
		<blockquote>
			I behold the treacherous and loathe them,<br>Because they do not keep Thy word. – Psalm 119:158</blockquote>
		<p>It disqualifies a man from the honor and responsibilities of being a leader in the Church.&nbsp; His reputation, marriage, and family, in particular, are of great importance in evaluating 
		his ability to govern God's people and be an example to them.</p>
		<p>Husbands who have experienced the pain of an unfaithful wife may be comforted and strengthened by the Prophet Hosea.&nbsp; God also took a bride who later proved herself a harlot – an 
		adulteress.&nbsp; But this did not result in His breaking His covenant with her, putting her away, and making an entirely new covenant with someone else.&nbsp; God swore that He would never 
		break His covenant with Abraham and his descendants -- like most men nowadays, our Sovereign God is not faithless.</p>
		<p>Licentiousness dominates our culture and, as we might expect, is found within the body of Christ.&nbsp; We can only grieve at what lies ahead....<br>
		</p>

		<p>Israel's adultery had grave consequences.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp; But at no time did He say He would forsake her for another, as most do with their unfaithful wives or husbands.&nbsp; Would that 
		those men who know better be as the LORD:&nbsp; Faithful to one bride and only one – and each be a "one woman man" (1Tim. 3:2; Tit. 1:6).&nbsp; If one has more than one wife, he is not a one 
		woman man.</p>
		<h3>III. Divorce Defined</h3>
		<p>The modern definition of divorce is different in some ways than its meaning in ancient times.</p>
		<p>Since the Reformation period, the word implies not only the putting away of one's wife but also the dissolution of the marriage itself as if it had never been.&nbsp; In this way, the 
		so-called divorced person gains the alleged right to marry another.&nbsp; This is key to understanding why the heathen put so much importance on the action of the State, unlawful as it is, in 
		making and dissolving the marriage bond.</p>
		<p>The Protestant church adopted this definition because it is so handy for the broader purpose of weakening what God has joined together and giving sinners in the congregation justification 
		for evil.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>If the modern definition of divorce is true, it makes New Testament teaching on marriage difficult to understand: how could it be adultery against a first wife by marrying a second if the 
		first marriage was such as if it had never taken place?&nbsp; If divorce completely dissolves a marriage, then how is some future adultery possible?&nbsp; How can one sin against someone with 
		whom one has no relationship?&nbsp; How could it have been adulterous for Herod to take the presumably divorced wife of his brother?</p>
		<p>The common definition of adultery today is the act of having an extra-marital affair with someone else.&nbsp; However, if that person is divorced or never married, then it is not adultery 
		in the eyes of most.&nbsp; It could be cheating, being immoral, or something but not adultery. Thankfully, Jesus' teachings on marriage ignore the notion of the modern meaning of divorce all 
		together: that the marriage bond is completely broken and that the person is free to marry another.</p>
		<p>Whether some authority or a person's own opinion declares him divorced or not, Jesus teaches that it is always adulterous to take a woman who is/has been married unless her husband is dead 
		(c.f. Rom. 7). This is why a man wishing to be in church leadership must be a one woman man (1Tim. 3:2).</p>
		<p>It does not say he must not be divorced (or separated from his wife in the biblical definition).&nbsp; This is because a man can be separated from his wife on the grounds, for example, of 
		sexual misconduct but she is still his wife.&nbsp; With the Holy Spirit's help, he can (and must) remain single (1 Cor. 7:11)<sup>8</sup>.&nbsp; If the wife quits her adultery and returns, the 
		marriage can be restored.</p>
		<p>However, if the wife remarries and then changes her mind, what then?&nbsp; Deut. 24:1-4 commands that a divorced woman who remarries may not return to her first husband because she became 
		defiled by marrying the second husband.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp; It would be detestable in the eyes of the LORD.&nbsp; Are Christians to do things that are detestable to God?&nbsp; The
		<a href="../antinomianism.htm">antinomian</a> 
		argues that it does not matter – Christ has taken care of it on the Cross.&nbsp; Most antinomians would not argue that we have God's blessing to sin with abandon but, nonetheless, our sin is 
		of no consequence whether we repent of it or not.</p>
		<p>As with Herod, every time a remarried person goes into the new spouse it is adultery – it is an illegal union in God's eyes and the sexual relationship must cease.&nbsp; Unconverted men and 
		rebellious Christians do not want to consider this.&nbsp; The Christian may bitterly complain but why did not he think about this before maliciously deserting the wife of his youth?&nbsp; It 
		is like murder.&nbsp; "I am so sorry about it."&nbsp; However, it does not bring back the life of the dead man.</p>
		<p>How is ceasing from conjugal activity possible in a culture that worships and glamorizes sex?&nbsp; If most in the churches are not true Christians then forsaking immorality to be obedient 
		to Christ is unlikely to be common place.&nbsp; Church leadership over the ages has recognized this problem and it has&nbsp;been a titanic struggle similar to Stephen's predicament in Acts 6.&nbsp; 
		Most have acquiesced to the world's values but not all.<sup>10</sup></p>
		<p>The modern church has adopted the customs of the world regarding the definition of marriage.&nbsp; In the end the result is a godless distortion of the truth which renders swaths of 
		Scripture irrelevant or nonsensical.<sup>11</sup></p>
		<p>Jesus taught that any one who divorces his wife (for whatever reason) and marries another commits adultery against the first wife (Mk. 10:11.&nbsp; Mt. 5:32 teaches that putting one's wife 
		away (but not subsequently remarrying another) causes her to become an adulteress – unless she had committed adultery against her first husband.&nbsp; If she had, he can put her away – but he 
		cannot remarry, in any case.</p>
		<blockquote>
			But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery. - Mt. 
			5:32</blockquote>
		<p>Both Jewish and Roman law in the 1st century required the husband to put away an adulterous wife.&nbsp; Consequently, Joseph was compelled to divorce Mary for her apparent adultery.&nbsp; 
		He had a great dilemma.</p>
		<p>Joseph could separate from Mary but he himself would have to remain single.&nbsp; This is the command of 1 Cor. 7:10.&nbsp; Mt. 5:32 does not imply that the marriage is now dissolved and 
		that the faithful spouse would now be as if he was never married in the first place.</p>
		<p>It is still the better option to not send the adulterer/adulteress away but this implies&nbsp;that the wayward spouse had repented.&nbsp; Otherwise, how could anyone live with a spouse who was 
		actively engaged in a sexual relationship with another?</p>
		<p>Would Joseph have then committed adultery against Mary by a divorce and subsequently marrying another?&nbsp; Mark 10:11, among others, affirms this because Mary is still his wife, 
		regardless of what she might do.&nbsp; He can still commit adultery against her.&nbsp; But what does Jesus mean in Mt. 19:9?&nbsp; Would this provide the exception for Joseph to remarry?&nbsp; 
		The modern translation apparently gives the grounds that he could:</p>
		<blockquote>
			I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery. Mt. 19:9</blockquote>
		<p>This is the single nail on which evangelical Protestants hang their doctrines of marriage and divorce.&nbsp; It provides the alleged exception to Jesus' general teachings that all divorce 
		for whatever reason and a subsequent remarriage is always adulterous.&nbsp; It&nbsp;also makes the general teaching on marriage and divorce in Scripture incoherent.</p>
		<p>Incoherent teaching in Scripture is a windfall for the wicked.&nbsp; But is it so incoherent?<br></p>
		<p>As a result, who knows what constitutes the grounds for divorce, if any?&nbsp; Is remarriage after divorce allowed?</p>
		<blockquote>
			It is unclear so I will have to make my own decision since who knows what the truth is?&nbsp; God wants me to be happy so I will error on the side of my perceived happiness. – John Adulterer</blockquote>
		<p>And the Church goes along.</p>
		<p>Is it adulterous for one to put away a wife or a husband even without the prospect of our remarrying?</p>
		<p>The answer is given in Mt. 5:32:&nbsp;it is – unless the one put away had been guilty of immorality.&nbsp; But is does not mean that the faithful spouse can remarry, as most assume.</p>
		<p>Is there an alternative, even minor, translation of Mt. 19:9 that maintains the unity of God's Word?&nbsp; Instead of "marital unfaithfulness", the correct and clearer translation should be 
		"sexual misconduct".&nbsp; While this passage certainly has adultery in mind, the Greek word for adultery is not used as it is in Mt. 5:32.&nbsp; Marital unfaithfulness is adultery and there 
		is a Greek word for it.&nbsp; Instead, the more general word for sexual misconduct (porneia) is used instead.</p>
		<p>It is unfortunate that the NIV translators of the Sacred Text made an a priori decision here.&nbsp; In their thinking, the passages must refer to Jesus' approving divorce and remarriage 
		under certain circumstances.</p>
		<p>"<em>How could Jesus allow the dissolution of a marriage based on mere sexual misconduct?</em>" they may have reasoned.</p>
		<p>To translate the Greek word "porneia" as "sexual misconduct" (KJV: fornication; NASB: immorality) would allow Christians, in the minds of the translators, to divorce and remarry for 
		virtually any reason, including a husband giving another woman more attention than he ought (Mt. 5:28).</p>
		<p>This may have been an important concern of theirs but it is just a guess.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the adulterers in the Church took this excuse and ran with it.&nbsp; Now, anyone can divorce 
		for any reason whatever.</p>
		<h2>III.&nbsp; A Better Translation of Mt. 19:9</h2> 
		<p>In this verse we have the obscure Greek phrase "epi me porneia" (translated in English versions as "except for immorality/marital unfaithfulness/misconduct").&nbsp; However, in order to 
		preserve the theological integrity of the Bible, it could also be translated</p>
		<blockquote>...not even for sexual misconduct [can he divorce her].</blockquote>
		<p>Translated this way, Jesus' teaching in the passage suddenly makes sense rather than appear disconnected and incoherent -- which is one of the stealthy tactics of Satan to deceive God's 
		Elect.&nbsp; While the former translation may be better standalone, the latter is the only one that makes sense in the local context and with Jesus' other teachings on divorce.</p>
		<p>The latter translation corrects the unlikely notion that Jesus would side with the Pharisees – the very ones who were determined to disgrace and kill Him.</p>
		<p>But how did the former translation ever become a possibility when every other teaching in the Bible upholds the permanency of marriage, despite what a spouse may do?</p>
		<p>The esteemed and scholarly NIDNTT<sup>12</sup> 
		argues that Mt. 5:32 provides the context that requires the former and well known translation of the phrase.&nbsp; But it does not consider the context of Mt. 19 and similar passages in Luke 
		and Mark which, as a whole, contradict the current translation of the phrase.</p>
		<p>Were some of the brilliant and competent scholars who participated in the creation of the NIDNTT divorced and remarried?&nbsp; Would they, other things being equal, defer to opinion that 
		did not make them look bad?&nbsp; In other words, how can we ever be free of the fallen human nature every man has?&nbsp; One can only hope that he does not justify his sin but rather be like 
		David when he set to writing his great psalm of repentance.</p>
		<p id="Novum_Testamentum">During more than a decade of research on the history of the church's teaching on marriage, the author of this essay stumbled upon an important discovery.&nbsp; Some 
		early Reformer, mostly likely Erasmus, added the preposition "ei" before "epi me porneia" in the Greek text that was used at the time to translate the New Testament into their respective 
		native languages.</p>
		<p>The addition of "ei" makes the phrase unambiguously "except for sexual misconduct."&nbsp; But what was the motive for making this change?</p>
		<blockquote>That the editor and contributing authors of the NIDNTT, the most comprehensive and important theological dictionary of the New Testament ever written, were not aware of or chose to 
			ignore this addition to the Sacred Text during the Reformation period is unsettling.</blockquote>
		<p>Had the NIDNTT discussed this, it might have helped immensely in the discussion of a difficult theological issue in the New Testament.</p>
		<h3><strong>The Evidence</strong></h3>
		<p>Pictured here are the title page and the page containing Mt. 19:9 of the 1598 A.D. edition of Theodore Beza's Novum Testamentum.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Greek is on one side of the page and a Latin 
		translation of the Greek on the other.&nbsp; Beza's annotations are at the bottom.&nbsp; (This author overlaid some <a href="margin-notes.htm">notes</a> 
		in English on the image of the page on the right containing the Greek text for those who might desire a relatively simple explanation of the addition.)<br>

		many other ancient documents are available from <a href="http://www.e-rara.ch/wiki/aboutERara">
		e-rara.ch</a>.)</p>
		<p>The structure is much like today's study Bible but it is in Latin and Greek.&nbsp; Beza relied on Erasmus' work for his editions which were subsequently used by translators.&nbsp; The 
		implications of this discovery for our understanding of Jesus' teaching on marriage are significant.</p>
		<p>That is, if a man divorces his wife and marries another – even if she had engaged in some sort of sexual misconduct – he still commits adultery.&nbsp; This is what the Church Fathers taught 
		and is in harmony with all orthodox teaching except that of the Protestant era.</p>
		<p>Post-Reformation teaching on divorce and adultery therefore hangs on what is an addition to the Greek text.</p>
		<p>Recent scholarship confirmed the addition so why have modern translators continued to retain the so-called exception clause that originated with the Reformers?&nbsp; It does not appear to 
		be an accident, either then or now.&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism">Humanism</a> 
		has had a major influence on the Reformation.</p>
		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desiderius_Erasmus">Erasmus</a>, a brilliant scholar, Humanist, but unlikely a converted man, provided the Greek texts of the New Testament which were 
		used during this period for translations, including the text of the Novum Testamentum used by Beza.&nbsp; Was he the one who changed the Greek text to suit his theological views?</p>
		<p>The Latin text in Beza's Novum Testamentum and the Vulgate read "...except for immorality."&nbsp; It is likely that Erasmus changed the Greek text to agree with the Latin.</p>
		<h3><strong>Reversogesis</strong></h3>
		<p>It is not an uncommon practice, especially today, for Bible teachers to fish through endless English translations in order to glean the meanings they desire.&nbsp; It could be described as 
		"reversogesis".&nbsp; Instead of going to the Sacred Text desiring what God has to say to us, it is the opposite: how can I manipulate the text to get it so say what I want?&nbsp; This is a 
		fine art among Evangelicals of this age.</p>
		<p>What major contemporary American evangelist has not misused Holy Scripture?<sup>13</sup></p>
		<p>On the other hand, the Apostolic Church Fathers were not confused about much of anything, especially what constituted adultery.&nbsp; They properly understood Matthew 5 &amp; 19 and the rest of 
		God's teaching on the nature of the marriage bond – it is inviolable.&nbsp; It is so strong a bond that its strength and permanence can remain, in part, even after the death of a spouse (Dt. 
		24; Lev. 18:8).</p>
		<p>The similar passages in Mark and in Luke have no so-called exception.&nbsp; How could Jesus speak of such an important issue and also leave out important information?&nbsp; With Matt. 19:9 
		correctly translated, He did not.&nbsp; In this passage He merely strengthened what He had already taught elsewhere.</p>
		<p>Divorce and remarriage has become so common among Christians that any pastor risks losing his job if he confronts it.&nbsp; If sleeping with the wife of another man was good for C. S. 
		Lewis, it must be a godly thing to do for all Christians.&nbsp; Who could know the truth better than he?&nbsp; These are the sorts of things we are up against in dealing with the effects of 
		the Reformation and the statements of faith of that period, including a legal fiction in the
		<a href="../bilical-advice-on-second-marriage.htm#The_legal_fiction">Westminster Confession</a>.</p>
		<p>The common post-Reformation interpretation of Mt. 19:9 promotes nonsensical teachings concerning remarriage after divorce.&nbsp; For example, if the typical translation and interpretation 
		of this passage is accurate, it is not adulterous to remarry if wife #1 is adulterous herself.&nbsp; But if wife #1 is not adulterous (she abandoned the marriage and remained single, for 
		example) then remarriage for the abandoned husband would consequently be adulterous for him.</p>
		<p>If wife #1 later remarried, that marriage would be adulterous but not if she had initially committed adultery because the first marriage would have been "dissolved."</p>
		<p>Evangelical seminaries avoid this topic.&nbsp; It is like radioactive waste.</p>
		<p>Too many professors, donors, and trustees have abandoned wife #1 for wife #2 and godly faculty are too terrified to discuss it.&nbsp; They know what happened to John the Baptist.&nbsp; 
		Exceptions are rare.&nbsp; The Church of England briefly had a canon (#107 A.D. 1603) stating that separation or annulment is authorized but divorce with permission to remarry is not.&nbsp; 
		This was likely the work of the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Whitgift, who, along with Queen Elizabeth I, was hostile to the Puritans and other Protestants and faithful to the&nbsp; Church 
		of Rome.&nbsp; For all her sins, the Church of Rome is to be commended for staying faithful to the Scriptures in this regard, at least on paper.</p>
		<p>Many Christians are confused by the typical evangelical teachings on what constitutes adultery.&nbsp; For this we may attribute it to our dreadful enemy, the Great Satan, and sinful human 
		nature.&nbsp; Specifically, there is the mixing of Renaissance humanism with the Christian faith done by most Reformers and, especially, leaders of today's churches.&nbsp; It has given us the 
		fertile soil within which the seeds of immorality are maturing in what's left of the Church in the West.&nbsp; The wreckage continues....</p>
		<p>The demise of Europe as any sort of Christian beacon in the world might be attributed to this fallout of the Reformation:&nbsp;the widespread perversion of the sacred lifelong covenant of 
		marriage between a man and a woman.&nbsp; In ancient Israel the warnings against immorality and adultery, in particular, are manifest.&nbsp; The consequences for these acts were the near total 
		destruction of Israel.&nbsp; For other nations, however, the judgment was utter and complete destruction.</p>
		<p>If the typical interpretation of Mt. 19:9 is correct, the eunuch sayings of Jesus in Mt. 19:10-12 make no sense.&nbsp; Why is it such an impossible burden if a man can divorce his wife and 
		marry another if the first wife is adulterous?&nbsp; It is hardly a burden to have to divorce such a wife and then go find another if the Reformers and most Evangelicals are correct.&nbsp; How 
		can it be better never to marry under such a condition?&nbsp; The correct interpretation of this passage brings this dilemma into context.</p>
		<p>If all remarriage after divorce is adulterous, then it may indeed be better to never marry in the first place.&nbsp; But for modern Westerners it is, "God forbid!&nbsp; How could I live 
		without sex?"</p>
		<p>The Early Church understood this.</p>
		<p>Jesus does not abandon the married Christian who now must live celibately to a life of frustration and loneliness.&nbsp; Thankfully, His Elect have been given the ability to live a holy 
		life by the indwelling power of His Holy Spirit (Mt. 19:11).&nbsp; We do not bear our crosses alone; we are not abandoned as orphans; He does not call us to a life of suffering without either 
		compensation or the power to live such a life.&nbsp; Just as the brothers will be equipped with the right words to say in front of their persecutors (Mk. 13:11), so will we be equipped for 
		everything.&nbsp; What task could confront the beloved of the King of kings that he could not complete in the power of the Holy Spirit?&nbsp; How is God's sovereignty overcome by evil flesh?</p>
		<blockquote>I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.&nbsp; – Jn. 15:5</blockquote>
		<p>It is the essence of faith to accept from His Hand whatever comes our way, good or bad.</p>
		<p>The Bible and history books are replete with examples of faithful men and women who did not just give up their lands and property, their wives or husbands but their very lives as well – all 
		in view of the Glory which is to come.</p>
		<p>Is it not possible that the Christian might be required to forego the married life?&nbsp; For the majority of the Evangelical world, the answer is <em>"Never!"</em></p>
		<p>No doubt, if we all were living in ancient Sodom we, too, would find homosexuality a difficult evil to denounce much less refrain from.&nbsp; In today's culture, it is a sexual free-for-all 
		and a repulsive blight in the universe which will be met soon enough with the Creator's wrath.</p>
		<p>In addition to the eunuch sayings being nonsense with the typical interpretation of the passage, Jesus also contradicts Himself.&nbsp; He first says one thing (marriage is permanent) and 
		then later reverses Himself (it is not permanent) and, in the end, agrees with a group of the Pharisees known as the Shammaites who held to the notion that divorce and remarriage are 
		permissible only in the case of adultery. </p>
		<p>Does the Creator of the heavens and the earth reverse Himself and suddenly agree with those who had one goal in mind:&nbsp; To trap and kill Him?&nbsp; Which side are we on?&nbsp; The 
		Pharisees?&nbsp; Jesus?</p>
		<h3><strong>John 8:3ff</strong></h3>
		<p>Another so-called pillar used to minimize the evil of adultery is the common misunderstanding of the woman supposedly caught in adultery (John 8:3ff).&nbsp; Evangelicals use this vignette 
		as a proof that adultery is a minimal offense: "Go and sin no more...."</p>
		<p>First of all, few note that the Pharisees had one goal:&nbsp;to trap Jesus in His words and so be able to bring about the grounds for trial and execution.</p>
		<p>Everywhere, as here, the Pharisees use worldly wisdom to fabricate traps so that whatever Jesus does, He is either wrong, extreme, or, if He says nothing, is disgraced.&nbsp; Simply, this 
		encounter is just another trap.</p>
		<p>The woman cannot commit adultery by herself.&nbsp; <em>Where is the man?</em></p>
		<p>&nbsp;Since when would the Sanhedrin defer to Jesus for a judicial decision that is rightfully their own?&nbsp; They hoped He would say either "no" (and then accuse Him of defying the Law) or 
		"yes" (and arouse the masses against Him).&nbsp; In either case, He would be the subject of more serious charges or lose the goodwill of the ordinary Jew.</p>
		<p>It is likely that the woman was an actress.&nbsp; Jesus' words to her was "...leave your life of sin."&nbsp; This is an unspecific command that would describe the life of someone who was 
		generally given over to all kinds of sin, not just adultery.&nbsp; Jesus did not command her to return to her husband, for example.&nbsp; The gaping holes in the passage cannot be ignored.</p>
		<p>This is to say nothing of the fact that the entire story is missing from early manuscripts of the gospel of John and so, is suspect of not being Scripture in the first place.&nbsp; Who was 
		the inventor of this tale?&nbsp; Why was it done?&nbsp; There are many who believe that remarriage after divorce should be allowed.&nbsp; If Scripture does not teach this, it ought to, they 
		reason.</p>
		<p>The marriage bond even survives death in an important way.&nbsp; Such a bond is illustrated in Lev. 18 where sexual unions are prohibited among those who have new horizontal relationships 
		that were created by the marriage union.</p>
		<blockquote>No one is to approach any close relative to have sexual relations. I am the LORD.&nbsp; Do not dishonor your father by having sexual relations with your mother. She is your mother; do 
			not have relations with her.&nbsp; Do not have sexual relations with your father's wife; that would dishonor your father. Lev. 18:6-8</blockquote>
		<p>The sin of the man noted in 1Cor. 5 was of the nature mentioned above.&nbsp; Having sexual relations with the wife of one's father (not one's mother) would, of course, be adulterous if the 
		father were alive and such a union is not addressed in Lev. 18, as we would expect.</p>
		<p>The prohibitions in the verses above are based on the prohibition against incest, not against adultery.&nbsp; How is a son's having relations with his father's widow (but not his mother) a 
		form of incest if there is no blood relationship with her?&nbsp; It would only be so if the father's marriage to the otherwise unrelated woman created a bond that is as strong or stronger than 
		a bond by blood.&nbsp; One's brother is always one's brother, even if he is dead.</p>
		<p>One's wife will always be one's wife, even if she is dead.<sup>14</sup></p>
		<p>Interestingly, the Early Church would not allow the marriage between a man who was a widower and a woman if he had lived with her prior to the death of his first wife.&nbsp; These godly 
		bishops understood that men are incorrigibly evil and there is no end to the schemes they will use to indulge in sin.&nbsp; Can God raise up for us bishops like the men of old?&nbsp; This 
		would be this writer's most earnest desire.</p>
		<p>The amusing idea of the virtual death of a spouse is enshrined in the Westminster Confession (24:5).&nbsp; In the case of this otherwise godly confession, the faithful are permitted to 
		engage in a kind of legal fiction.</p>
		<blockquote>
			I can treat my adulterous wife as if she was actually dead (but really is not) and, thanks to Rom. 7, I am now free to marry another.</blockquote>
		<p>In this way the authors of the Confession accomplished the goal of legitimizing adulterous remarriage.&nbsp; The English translations of the Bible from that time on have assisted in 
		perpetuating this error, including the Authorized (King James) Version, as noted earlier in this essay.</p>
		<p>Evangelicals often misuse Scripture, e.g., Mt. 5:28, to falsely accuse a spouse of adultery.&nbsp; It is common to hear Bible teachers minimize adultery by using this verse to assert that 
		everyone is an adulterer so why all the concern?&nbsp; They fail to once again to divide the Word properly.</p>
		<p>Our God will deal with the sins of the heart.&nbsp; The Church, on the other hand, must reckon with the outward results of the inward sin.&nbsp; Just because one has covetous desires but 
		does not act them out does not mean all men, including him, are therefore thieves and to be judged in the same way by a magistrate or the Church.</p>
		<p>The man caught in 1 Cor. 5 was not fantasizing about his father's widow – he was sleeping with her – something lost in the theology of Evangelicals.&nbsp; He had to stop sleeping with her 
		and own up to his sin.&nbsp; His sin was not a past event but continues as long as he has sex with his father's widow.&nbsp; Such a distinction is also lost among Evangelical of today.</p>
		<p>If the man just owned up but continued to live with his widowed step-mother, we would have what we have today in more and more churches: <a href="../antinomianism.htm">antinomianism</a>.</p>
		<p>What man in a weak moment has not gazed at an attractive woman?&nbsp; By misusing this Scripture, the husband is now an adulterer.&nbsp; According to modern Evangelical interpretations of 
		Mt. 19, including the Westminster Confession, the wife can abandon the marriage and find another (and supposedly better) husband because her husband has committed adultery and is now virtually 
		dead.</p>
		<p>Careful and consistent interpretation of Scripture reveals what a falsehood this notion is and it stands condemned as just another scheme some use to flatter and pander to sin in the 
		Church.&nbsp; Many spiritual descendants of the Reformers continue to dig a deeper and deeper pit for all to fall in.&nbsp; The Church continues to shrink in the West and, like the Israelites 
		in Sinai, clamor for a god they can touch and sing songs to.</p>
		<h2>IV.&nbsp; CONCLUSION</h2>
		<p>The current notions concerning both adultery and the grounds and consequences of divorce are based on&nbsp;erroneous interpretations and poor translations of Scripture motivated by a desire to 
		loosen the bonds of marriage.</p>
		<p>The roots of this seismic shift in the teachings of the Church go back to the Reformation and, in particular, to Erasmus who mixed his humanistic views with the Christian faith: "Man has a 
		right to happiness."&nbsp; This, in turn, has provided a cover for the widespread immorality overtaking the Church in the west and the ubiquitous "what's-in-it-for-me" gospel and widespread 
		disregard for biblical truth.</p>
		<p>What about the civil authority's role in marriage?&nbsp; As marriage was instituted before the existence of civil society, it cannot, therefore, be a civil institution by nature.&nbsp; 
		Consequently, the magistrate has no authority to dissolve a marriage – even an absolute dictator like Herod.&nbsp; John and Baptist understood this which was why he called Herodias "Philip's 
		wife."</p>
		<p>God alone dissolves a marriage – and that only through the actual death of a spouse.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herod's relationship to Herodias was adulterous.&nbsp; John lost his head as a result of 
		preaching the truth – and so may we.</p>
		<blockquote>	Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate. Mk. 10:9</blockquote>
		<blockquote>To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband.&nbsp; But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her 
			husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. 1Cor. 7:10-11</blockquote>
		<p>What is ambiguous about these commands?</p>
		<p>What is ambiguous is the Church's response to the heathen and their excesses.&nbsp; Where are the so-called exceptions?</p>
		<p>For a man to put away his wife is to strike at the core of one of our most important doctrines:&nbsp; Christ's permanent and indissoluble unity and love for His bride, the Church.&nbsp; 
		Such an act is treachery and an insult to the Spirit of Grace which preserves the Church.</p>
		<p>Just as the LORD often endured an adulterous bride (and still does), so can we.&nbsp; An example of how the parallel is so close and striking is the LORD's taking of Ezekiel's wife.&nbsp; 
		He illustrated for adulterous Israel the intense pain they were causing Him – her husband (Ezek. 14:15).</p>
		<p>While there is no sin which cannot be forgiven, there are always consequences that are permanent.&nbsp; Having more than one wife in one's lifetime disqualifies a man from leadership in the 
		Church.&nbsp; A Church leader must be a one-woman man as 1 Tim. 3 demands.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, another fabrication of the Evangelical is the notion that the Apostle Paul was prescribing against polygyny in 1 Tim. 3.&nbsp;
		<a href="monogamy-and-polygyny-by-walter-scheidel.pdf">Heathen scholars</a> 
		have established without reservation that the Greco-Roman of Paul's time did not permit polygyny or polyandry.&nbsp; Why would the Apostle prescribe something that did not exist?<br><br>As 
		everywhere, what did exist was what we know today as serial polygamy: people having multiple husbands or wives but one at a time.&nbsp; This is why Paul, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, 
		states that a leader in the Church must be a one-woman-man.&nbsp; He has no wife #1, #2, and so forth.</p>
		<p>Not only adulterers are excluded from Church leadership but also widowers who have remarried.&nbsp; How are they a good example, especially to their children?&nbsp; What happens when the 
		photos of mom come down and the photos of the current honey go up?&nbsp; "Why don't you love mom/dad anymore?"</p>
		<p>If one has trouble with the cravings of the flesh, consult with a surgeon.</p>
		<blockquote>If your hand or your foot causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown 
			into eternal fire.&nbsp; And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of 
			hell. -- Matt. 18:8-9</blockquote>
		<p>A man who is divorced and then remarries is a polygynist even though he may fancy that his previous marriage is dissolved.&nbsp; If he is repentant, he still can fully enjoy the fellowship 
		and communion of God's people – but cannot teach nor lead because he cannot be trusted, among other reasons, as the Scriptures affirm.</p>
		<p>A man who violates his solemn vows is not an example to anyone and certainly not above reproach – except among other men who have done the same.</p>
		<p>The Early Church Fathers understood this and, accordingly, required those who were victims of unfaithful wives to remain celibate in the hope that the adulterous wife might, someday, return 
		and be restored.&nbsp; Such a celibate man could still serve in Church leadership.&nbsp; This is only just.&nbsp; How can any man ultimately control the heart of another, especially an 
		adulterous wife?</p>
		<p>Our nation is in a spiritual and cultural death-spiral and most of the church just follows along.&nbsp; Both Roman Catholics and Protestants have suffered terribly at the hands of the 
		unrepentant immoral.&nbsp; The former have had to endure an ecclesiastical structure which tolerates sexual attacks on children by priests.&nbsp; The latter have had to endure leadership 
		which, similarly, looks the other way at another kind of serious sexual sin – like adultery.</p>
		<p>But what Evangelical leader is stricken by the horror of the widespread adultery in our midst or has denounced the legal fiction in the Westminster Confession?<sup>15</sup><br>

		<p>Many have embraced adultery – including homosexuality, abortion, and fornication.</p>
		<p>May all Christians heed the commands of Scripture – and avail themselves of that Divine Power within to do so.&nbsp; We have invited God's judgment by refusing to be obedient with regards 
		to the holiness and permanency of the marriage union.&nbsp; Israel was all but destroyed for holding God's commands in this regard in contempt.&nbsp; Are we Gentiles, who have been grafted in, 
		exempt from obedience?&nbsp; Can we experience a great lenience?</p>

		<sup>1</sup>In this essay, when the term "divorce" is used, the meaning has the biblical definition of putting away one's spouse.&nbsp; It does not mean that the marriage is also dissolved as if it 
		had never been, a modern invention.<br>
		<sup>2</sup>Here is some
		<a href="../bilical-advice-on-second-marriage.htm">counsel</a> from the Bible to those who are already in such marriages.&nbsp; He who complains that it is too hard to remain celibate should have 
		thought of that before deserting the wife of his youth.&nbsp; There are terrible consequences for sin – as much as people prefer to deny it.<br>
		<sup>3</sup>Here is a <a href="../misuse-1corinthians6-16-17.htm">discussion</a> of this and a translation of the passage that does not make it conflict with other broad biblical teaching,&nbsp; 
		But this begs the question: can someone translate a passage that does not suit his own theological opinions?&nbsp; It is unavoidable.&nbsp; It is this writer's concern that if there are, let's say, 
		three ways to translate a passage of Scripture, should one choose that which maintains the theological integrity of the Bible even if it is grammatically not the best?&nbsp; The answer should be 
		"yes" but it is not an easy job.&nbsp; One's theological positions have an enormous influence on how one translates Scripture.&nbsp; What are the theological positions of the translators of the NIV?&nbsp; 
		The KJV?&nbsp; The NASB?&nbsp; It seems clear that most translators believe that divorce and remarriage are acceptable.&nbsp; Recent translations of the New Testament have, unfortunately, the paw-prints of 
		the feminists all over them.&nbsp; For the feminist, barrenness and singlehood are not a disgrace nor is independence from a man.&nbsp; Instead, the feminists relish that which women of earlier periods 
		of history would consider a disaster.&nbsp; These modern women would be disgraced in any other period of Christian and Jewish history but our own where their perversions are not only embraced but 
		celebrated.<br><sup>4</sup>For additional details on what constitutes marriage, the reader can see this writer's discussion of the 
		<a href="../four-marriage-essentials.htm">Four Essentials of Marriage</a>.<br>
		<sup>5</sup>This is the phrase that the scholarly New International Dictionary of Old Testament Theology and Exegesis (NIDOTTE) uses to translate the Hebrew verb BGD.<br>
		<sup>6</sup>A universal paradigm in Scripture is the picture of Israel as an adulteress to whom God has declared He will always be faithful in spite of anything she might do.&nbsp; The book of 
		Hosea is a prime example of this.<br>
		<sup>7</sup>"Destruction for Israel is inexorable because Yahweh's holiness demands severe purgation of the incorrigible people's seemingly ineradicable fixation with rebellion." – New 
		International Dictionary of Old Testament Theology and Exegesis.&nbsp; If we substitute "the Church" for "Israel", it might bring to bear more readily the great crisis that awaits the Church in the 
		West.<br>
		<sup>8</sup>Unconverted men mock such a requirement because they are neither filled with nor overseen and empowered by the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; The drunk mocks the requirement that he must cease 
		putting the whiskey bottle to his lips until he is converted and born anew.&nbsp; "I can do everything through him who gives me strength." --Php. 4:13&nbsp; How a man responds to God's commands is one 
		of the best tests we have to determine whether he is a converted man or not.&nbsp; The Kings David and Saul are classic examples of this.&nbsp; We can only surmise that the churches are full of 
		unconverted men.&nbsp; If one is living a sinful life, he can only hope he will agree with God, repent, hate his sin, and turn from it – in sackcloth and ashes.&nbsp; God forbid that a man should ever 
		boast that he did it in his own strength.<br>
		<sup>9</sup>Contrary to nearly all modern commentaries, the New International Dictionary of Old Testament Theology and Exegesis notes that Deut. 24 is not about divorce but about defilement.&nbsp; 
		A woman who has sex with another man while her first husband is alive is defiled.&nbsp; The Scriptures have no categories of "ex-wife" or "ex-husband."&nbsp; The passage in Deut. 24, for example, does 
		not refer to the woman's first husband as her "ex-husband" but as her "first husband".&nbsp; A modern man may fancy that he can refer to the covenant bride of his youth as his "ex-wife" but this is 
		a falsehood:&nbsp;she is his first wife -- and will always remain such.<br>
		<sup>10</sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_More">Thomas Moore</a> faced death for standing up for the truth.&nbsp; Do most in the churches love obedience more than life itself?&nbsp; Past 
		history from every age indicates not.&nbsp; If Peter struggled with this, all of God's Elect can expect to betray the Son of God in some way.&nbsp; We can only hope He will give us the strength to 
		persevere in all circumstances.&nbsp; It is a humbling paradigm.<br>
		<sup>11</sup>The NIV's translation of Matt. 19:3-12 is a good example of theological opinion trumping the integrity of Holy Scripture.&nbsp; The passage makes no sense as it stands in the English – 
		unless one is looking for an excuse to divorce and then remarry another.&nbsp;<br>

		<sup>13</sup>It was for this reason that the writer of this essay created this website in order to document the theological looseness, errors, and blunders of American Evangelicals whose 
		interests appear to be more in promoting themselves and catering to the sins of the people rather than in taking the heat from the inherently offensive Gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; 
		<em>"All men must believe in the only Son of God, repent, and prove it by their deeds."</em> - Acts 26:20<br>
		<sup>14</sup>There are limited exceptions – we are not married in Heaven (Mt. 22:30) nor do those who remarry after the death of a spouse commit adultery (Rom. 7:2-3).&nbsp; An important note here 
		is that the Apostle bases his actions in 1 Cor. 5 on the Moral Law given in the Old Testament.&nbsp; If the Moral Law no longer applied to the Church, why would the Apostle appeal to it in the 
		first place?&nbsp; Of course, in the incoherent theology of today's Evangelicals anything can happen.<br>
		<sup>15</sup>There are, however, exceptions to the general attitude of Protestant clergy toward divorce and remarriage but they are rare. Like John the Baptist, these clergy take such a stand 
		at great cost: go along with the adulterers or be run out of town.&nbsp; Pastor John Piper was at odds with his own internal leadership but they – for some reason – tolerated him anyway. We can 
		only hope that more pastors will rise to the occasion and see that the Church's very existence in the West is at stake. But who wants to be fired and then run out of town? We all need more 
		courage.</div>
