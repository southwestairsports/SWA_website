		<p>In <span class="italics">What is a Woman (Part I),</span> Marilyn and I discussed the biblical purpose, role, status of the woman.&nbsp; This is not just helpful information for Christian 
		women -- it is for all women.&nbsp; The more any woman of any time deviates from the Creator's plan for her, the more she may succumb to the Devil's schemes and her own sin.&nbsp; In the end, 
		it is all a disaster of one sort or another.</p>
		<p>In this essay, I wish to discuss the biased modern English translations of the Bible and how most misuse the Sacred Text to promote the agendas of translation committees.&nbsp; In 
		particular, I will look at the word translated "partner" in the Old Testament.&nbsp; What is at stake?&nbsp; If typical modern translations, like the NIV, are correct, then the theological 
		integrity of Holy Scripture has been undone.&nbsp; If this is so, how are we to know Truth concerning who we are?&nbsp; The Holy Spirit may witness one thing in the believer and then his 
		pastor teach something else.&nbsp; Who should I believe?&nbsp; How can I trust inner "feelings"?&nbsp; Marilyn and I are acquainted with this dilemma first hand.</p>
		<p>On key issues, the Flock of God is often in turmoil and confusion because of deceived pastors and teachers.&nbsp; Some have hidden agendas, some are the Devil's offspring, some place too 
		much trust in the wisdom of Man, others have failed to learn the languages the Bible was written in, and so on.</p>
		<blockquote>For the lips of a priest ought to preserve knowledge, and from his mouth men should seek instruction--because he is the messenger of the LORD Almighty. -- Mal. 2:7</blockquote>
		<p>These issues are not minor: adultery, the permanency of marriage, a woman's position in Creation.&nbsp; With regard to these, the modern Western Church is crosswise with the Early Church.&nbsp; 
		Has the Bible changed?&nbsp; The blood which flowed from the Holy veins of our LORD Jesus gave birth to His Body, the Church.&nbsp; Not soon after, the blood began to flow from His people: The 
		Early Christians.&nbsp; Their bold witness, moral purity, and sufferings for righteousness sake gave witness to the risen Christ and His presence among them.&nbsp; Their lives echoed, among 
		other things, the words of our Apostle in 1 Cor. 7:1</p>
		<blockquote>Since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God.&nbsp; </blockquote>
		<p>&nbsp;The Early Church understand the dangers of contamination and why we must always be seeking to purify ourselves.&nbsp; In these times, it seems that many are seeking the opposite: adopting 
		the worldviews of the heathen and indulging in their practices.&nbsp; This includes the adoption of feminism.</p>
		<p>So, when I was reading in Malachi 2 the other day, the word "partner" jumped off the page.&nbsp; This is the passage that forcefully addresses God's hatred of divorce and how men that leave 
		the brides of their youth are guilty of treachery.</p>
		<p>I went right to my Hebrew Bible and looked up the word and how it was used throughout the Old Testament.&nbsp; It became clear that the NIV’s translation of the Hebrew in Mal. 2:14 and 
		Prov. 2:17 was a poor choice with respect to the plain meaning of the two different Hebrew words used in these verses.</p>
		<p>According to the 1913 version of Merriam Webster, the English meaning of “partner” has changed over the last hundred years.&nbsp; In 1913, the word could refer to one’s husband or wife.&nbsp; 
		Today, it can mean one’s spouse or merely someone/something with whom one has sexual relations.</p>
		<p>Aside from some immoral relationship, a partner is someone with whom one has some common and defined purpose or task.&nbsp; Unlike the Hebrew, The English word "partner" does not convey any 
		aspect of friendship, loyalty, or the existence of a covenant.&nbsp; This is a critical difference between the two languages.</p>
		<p>Partner also conveys the aspect of equal rank.</p>
		<p>The husband and wife are no more partners than enlisted men and officers are in the military.&nbsp; Each member of the relationship has both common tasks (ensuring success) and one’s that 
		are unique (direction taken).&nbsp; One could say with accuracy that a husband and wife are partners when they are dancing together but even then one or the other must lead.&nbsp; But such 
		distinctions are lost on the heathen feminists.&nbsp; They seek to overthrow nature, a Sisyphean task and one that always fails in the end – except in modern American movies where feminist 
		propaganda is taken to the extreme.</p>
		<p>The Christian husband and wife are on equal footing with respect to their each being prisoners of sin and justified in the same manner (Gal. 3:22ff.)&nbsp; In this sense, they are partners 
		in sin.&nbsp; Contrary to popular church teaching, the context of this passage of Scripture has nothing to do with the rank and role of the justified man and justified woman.&nbsp; They do 
		share the common task of raising any children (Eph. 6:1ff).&nbsp; Even then, the primary and final responsibility for this task lies with the husband/father (Eph. 6:4).</p>
		<p>Only in modern English translations is the Hebrew word translated “partner”.&nbsp; The KJV translates it as “guide”.&nbsp; I am not sure of the precise Elizabethan use of the noun “guide” 
		but it does convey a level of intimacy and trust greater than the word “partner”.&nbsp; The NASB and NRSV translate it as “companion”, a term that is much closer in meaning to the Hebrew.&nbsp; 
		The Spanish Reina-Valera translates it as "companion" (compañera).&nbsp; Even the TNIV translates it as "wife".</p>
		<p>A better modern English translation which maintains the sense of the Hebrew would be “beloved companion”.</p>
		<p>If popular translations render the wife of one’s youth a mere partner, what is the crisis of being merely “faithless” (NIV) with a “partner”?&nbsp; But if one has “dealt treacherously” 
		(KJV, NASB), the sin becomes capital.</p>
		<p>Were the translation committees composed of the divorced (and remarried) who sought to lessen the sin they had committed?&nbsp; It seems likely.&nbsp; Regrettably, these types had positions 
		of authority in the seminaries from which I attended and graduated. Men who defend or mitigate the treachery they visited on the wives of their youth are not repentant men and the churches and 
		seminaries are full of them.</p>
		<p>Wedding ceremonies in the church now use the term “partner” to describe the relationship of the husband and wife.&nbsp; Where is this in Scripture as a primary description of the 
		relationship?&nbsp; Neither is the new wife exhorted to obey her husband (Gen. 3:16; Eph. 5:22-24; Col. 3:18; 1 Pet. 3:1ff.)&nbsp; How can a partner obey another partner, anyway?&nbsp; The 
		Ancient Ways have been largely abandoned.</p>
		<blockquote>Stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths, ask where the good way is, and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls.&nbsp; But you said, "We will not walk in 
			it." -- Jer. 6:16</blockquote>
		<p>As Charles Spurgeon once remarked, <span class="italics">“…we are not to adjust the Bible to fit the culture but adjust the culture to fit the Bible.”</span></p>
		<p>The fruits are evident: chaos in the family, rampant adultery and immorality among God’s people.</p>
		<p>If one starts poking around in the translations of Holy Scripture, it is easy to find bias.&nbsp; For example, the NIV translators decided to render the Hebrew in Prov. 16:28 as “close 
		friends” (NASB “intimate friends”, KJV “chief friends”).&nbsp; Why not partner?&nbsp; It is the same Hebrew root.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;Is the bride of your youth a mere partner or a
		<span class="italics">beloved companion</span>?</p>
		<blockquote>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.&nbsp; -- Eph. 5:25</blockquote>
		<p><span class="strong">Notes</span></p>
		<p>Etymology</p>
		<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hebrew words &amp; location: ’alup1 &nbsp;&nbsp;Ps. 55:13, 144:14; Pr. 2:17, 16:28, 17:9; Jer. 3:4, 11:19, 13:21; Mic. 7:5;&nbsp; chaberet&nbsp; &nbsp;Mal. 2:14 (but a close relative of this noun is used 
		a few dozen times elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible)</p>
		<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions: (from the New International Dictionary of Old Testament Theology and Exegesis -- NIDOTTE.)&nbsp; ’alup1 - friend, companion &nbsp;&nbsp;NIDOTTE:&nbsp; The only other three undisputed 
		uses of the nom. are in Proverbs where, in two cases (Prov. 16:28; 17:9), gossip is said to drive a wedge between friends and therefore must be eschewed. In the third instance (2:17) 'alup1 
		describes the most intimate and tender of friends, one's own spouse. The adulteress is one who leaves the friend of her youth, thus violating the marriage vows. chaberet - &nbsp;NIDOTTE: consort,&nbsp; 
		united, associate, KJV: companion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another hapleg. is chaberet, consort (Mal 2:14, LXX: chaberet), used in parallel with "your wife by covenant," a phrase reminiscent of the verbal 
		uses of chabar2 signifying alliances, but this is not a technical legal term.&nbsp; … Apart from the physical joining of materials of various kinds, the vb. is also used of people being 
		associated with one another. Joining in military and political alliances is the clear meaning in several passages.</p>
		<p>3.&nbsp; Verses:&nbsp; Prov. 2:16-17 NIV: <span class="italics">“It will save you also from the adulteress, from the wayward wife with her seductive words, who has left the partner of her 
		youth and ignored the covenant she made before God.”</span> &nbsp;KJV "guide"; NASB "companion"; NRSV "partner";&nbsp;&nbsp; Mal. 2:14 NIV: “<span class="italics">You ask, ‘Why?’ It is because the 
		LORD is acting as the witness between you and the wife of your youth, because you have broken faith with her, though she is your partner, the wife of your marriage covenant.”</span> &nbsp;KJV 
		"companion"; NASB "companion"; NRSV "companion".</p>
		<p>God help us!&nbsp; May He purify us from all sin and bring us into His Kingdom unstained....</p>
