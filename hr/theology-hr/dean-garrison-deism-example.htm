		<em>Below is a typical essay expressing deistic views.&nbsp; It is a mix of nationalism, patriotism, and the Christian faith.&nbsp; The bottom line is rebellion against established authority that the 
		writer believes is not illegal.&nbsp; It is primarily an expression of nationalism for a country and culture that no longer exists – sadly.&nbsp; I agree with his assessment of the character of the 
		current debris that has been elected but not with what he believes we should be content to do. It is Deism.&nbsp; Just because the Constitution clearly gives the citizens the right to overthrow 
		their government does not make it right or godly.&nbsp; There is no comparison today of the Federal authorities with the representatives of the British Parliament of 1770.&nbsp; The former engages in 
		far greater tyranny.&nbsp; Most Americans have no representation whatever at the Federal level and have become subjects of a criminal gang headed by the anti-white bigot and Communist Barack Obama 
		(as of 2014).&nbsp; What tyranny Mr. Obama leaves undone, the Supreme Court is pleased to follow through with more.&nbsp; What is the difference between an unelected gang of lawyers like the U.S. 
		Supreme Court making law and the British Parliament of 1770 making law without the consent of the Colonies?&nbsp; In other words, if only we could have King George III rather than the current 
		Federal government!&nbsp; For an essay on the 2nd Amendment, please go <a href="2nd-amendment-issues.htm">here</a>. – Hadley Robinson</em><br><br><strong>If They Come for Your Guns, Do You Have a 
		Responsibility to Fight? MUST READ!<br><br></strong>By Dean Garrison.<br><br>I feel a tremendous responsibility to write this article though I am a little apprehensive. Thinking about the 
		possibility of rising up against our own government is a frightening thing for many of us. I am not Johnny Rambo and I will be the first to admit that I do not want to die. The reason I feel 
		compelled to write this, however, is simply because I don’t think the average American is equipped with the facts. I feel that a lot of American citizens feel like they have no choice but to 
		surrender their guns if the government comes for them. I blame traditional media sources for this mass brainwash and I carry the responsibility of all small independent bloggers to tell the 
		truth. So my focus today is to lay out your constitutional rights as an American, and let you decide what to do with those rights. About a month ago I let the “democracy” word slip in a 
		discussion with a fellow blogger. I know better. Americans have been conditioned to use this term. It’s not an accurate term and it never has been a correct term to describe our form of 
		government. The truth is that the United States of America is a constitutional republic. This is similar to a democracy because our representatives are selected by democratic elections, but 
		ultimately our representatives are required to work within the framework of our constitution. In other words, even if 90% of Americans want something that goes against our founding principles, 
		they have no right to call for a violation of constitutional rights. If you are religious you might choose to think of it this way… Say that members of your congregation decide that mass 
		fornication is a good thing. Do they have the right to change the teachings of your God? The truth is the truth. It doesn’t matter how many people try to stray from it. Did I just compare our 
		founders to God? In a way I did, but please note that I am not trying to insult anyone. For the purpose of the American Government our constitution and founders who wrote it are much like God 
		is to believers. It is the law. It is indisputable. Our founders did not want a “democracy” for they feared a true democracy was just as dangerous as a monarchy. The founders were highly 
		educated people who were experienced in defending themselves against tyranny. They understood that the constitution could protect the people by limiting the power of anyone to work outside of 
		it much better than a pure system of popularity. A system of checks and balances was set up to help limit corruption of government and also the potential for an “immoral majority” developing 
		within the American People. We have forgotten in this country that we are ultimately ruled by a constitution. Why is a democracy potentially just as dangerous as a monarchy? Let’s look at 
		something that Benjamin Franklin said because it answers that question more fully and succinctly than I can. Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch. Liberty is a 
		well-armed lamb contesting the vote. -Benjamin Franklin Even 230+ years ago our founders were perceptive enough to realize that democracy was a dangerous form of government. How so? Because 
		the citizens of a country can become just as corrupt as any government. We have seen evidence of this throughout history. Ask Native Americans and African-Americans if this population can 
		become corrupt. I think in 2012 we were seeing evidence of what Franklin was trying to tell us. Just because a majority of people may support certain ideas it does not mean that those ideas 
		are just. In simple terms, just because most Americans voted for our president, it does not mean that he has the power to go against our constitutional rights. Next I’d like to review the text 
		of the second amendment. It is very clear. This is the law of this land. So when Senator Feinstein or President Obama talk about taking your guns, you need to think about something. Are they 
		honoring their sworn oath to uphold the constitution? A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be 
		infringed. This is a pretty clear statement. The fact is that it took 232 years for the Supreme Court to even rule on this amendment because it has never been successfully challenged. In 2008 
		a case of Columbia v. Heller the Supreme Court ruled that a handgun ban in Washington D.C. was unconstitutional. One also has to take this into consideration. The Supreme Court supports your 
		right to own guns. If you want to research this decision further you can start here. For those who try to debate the spirit of the 2nd amendment, they are truly no different from people who 
		will try to take Biblical quotes out of context to try to support their immoral decisions. The founders were very clear on the intent of the 2nd amendment. Let me share a few quick quotes 
		here: The strongest reason for people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government. -Thomas Jefferson Firearms stand next 
		in importance to the Constitution itself. They are the American people’s liberty teeth and keystone under independence … From the hour the Pilgrims landed, to the present day, events, 
		occurrences, and tendencies prove that to insure peace, security and happiness, the rifle and pistol are equally indispensable . . . the very atmosphere of firearms everywhere restrains evil 
		interference – they deserve a place of honor with all that is good. -George Washington The Constitution shall never be construed….to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable 
		citizens from keeping their own arms. -Samuel Adams I could find hundreds of quotes like these. This country was built on the right to bear arms. It was built on the rights of an individual to 
		bear arms, regardless of what his government or neighbor happened to think. This is crystal clear. Ironically the people who voice their opinions against this right have their free speech 
		protected by your guns. Without guns in this country, all other amendments become null and void, simply because “We the People” will lose our power of enforcement. We need to keep this in mind 
		as our “representatives” try to push gun bans. I don’t care if 99% of people are in support of gun bans (which is far from the case), it is a violation of our Constitutional rights, plain and 
		simple. A constitutional republic protects the rights of the individual even when their ideas are very much in the minority. If I were the only person in America who believed in the 2nd 
		amendment, I would still be within my rights to call upon it. You would all think I was insane and possibly celebrate if I was gunned down, but in the end I would be the only true American 
		among us. Our framers were very clear on this. If my government comes to take my guns, they are violating one of my constitutional rights that is covered by the 2nd amendment. It is not my 
		right, at that point, but my responsibility to respond in the name of liberty. What I am telling you is something that many are trying to soft sell, and many others have tried to avoid putting 
		into print, but I am going to say it. The time for speaking in code is over. You have the right to kill any representative of this government who tries to tread on your liberty. I am thinking 
		about self-defense and not talking about inciting a revolution. Re-read Jefferson’s quote. He talks about a “last resort.” I am not trying to start a Revolt, I am talking about self-defense. 
		If the day for Revolution comes, when no peaceful options exist, we may have to talk about that as well. None of us wants to think about that, but please understand that a majority can not 
		take away your rights as an American citizen. Congress could pass gun ban legislation by a 90%+ margin and it just would not matter. I think some people are very unclear on this. This is the 
		reason we have a Supreme Court, and though I do not doubt that the Supreme Court can also become corrupt, in 2008 they got it right. They supported the constitution. It does not matter what 
		the majority supports because America is not a democracy. A constitutional republic protects the rights of every single citizen, no matter what their “elected servants” say. A majority in 
		America only matters when the constitution is not in play. I just wrote what every believer in the constitution wants to say, and what every constitutional blogger needs to write. The truth of 
		the matter is that this type of speech is viewed as dangerous and radical or subversive, and it could gain me a world of trouble that I do not want. It is also the truth. To make myself clear 
		I will tell you again. If they come for your guns it is your right to use those guns against them and to kill them. You are protected by our constitution. Most of the articles I am reading on 
		the subject are trying to give you clues without just coming out and saying it. I understand that because certain things in this country will get you on a list that you don’t want to be on. I 
		may well be on that list. This blog is small and growing so I may not be there yet, but I have dreams. I also have my own list of subversives and anyone who attempts to deny my constitutional 
		rights is on that list. I am not the “subversive” here, it is the political representatives who are threatening to take away my inalienable rights. If they come to take my guns and I leave a 
		few of them wounded or dead, and I somehow survive, I have zero doubt that I will spend a long time in prison and may face an execution. But I would much rather be a political prisoner than a 
		slave. If I go down fighting then I was not fighting to harm these human beings. I was simply defending my liberty and yours. It is self-defense and it is what our country was built on. We won 
		our freedom in self-defense. We would not be ruled by a tyrannical government in the 1770′s and we will not be ruled in 2012 by a tyrannical government. There is no difference. This is a case 
		of right and wrong. As of now the 2nd amendment stands. It has never been repealed. If Feinstein or Barack have a problem with the constitution then they should be removed from office. They 
		are not defending the constitution which they have sworn an oath to protect. It is treasonous to say the least. They would likely say the same about me, but I have the constitution, the 
		founders, and the supreme court on my side. They only have their inflated egos. I am not writing this to incite people. I am writing this in hopes that somehow I can make a tiny difference. I 
		have no idea how many of my neighbors have the will to defend their constitutional rights. 2%? 20%? I am afraid that 20% is a high number, unfortunately. When push comes to shove many people 
		may give up and submit to being ruled. I believe that our government is banking on this. What I do know is that this country was founded by people who had courage the size of Texas and 
		Patriotic Americans take guff off of no one, especially our own government. For evidence of that, you might research the Revolutionary War. My question is how many Patriots are left? I would 
		hope that our officials come to realize that, regardless of our numbers, we still exist because they are calling Patriotic Americans to action. They are making us decide if we want to die free 
		or submit to their rule. I can not tell you where you should stand on that. I do know that it may make the difference between living a life of freedom or slavery. You must start thinking about 
		this because I believe that the day is coming soon and I personally believe it has already been planned. Not all conspiracy theories are hogwash. They may throw down the gauntlet soon and my 
		suggestion is that you prepare yourself to react. I mean no disrespect to our elected officials but they need to understand that “We the People” will not be disarmed. If they proceed then it 
		is they that are provoking us and we will act accordingly. We are within our rights to do so. For those who are in support of taking the guns, you need to ask yourself a very important 
		question, and I am not just talking about the politicians, because if you support them, you have chosen your side. Are you willing to die to prevent the govt (sic) from taking your guns? ~
