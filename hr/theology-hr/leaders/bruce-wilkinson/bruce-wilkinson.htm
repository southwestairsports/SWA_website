	<p>Reviewed by Hadley Robinson</p>Please go
		<a href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/BookReviews/jabez.htm">here</a> for a thorough review from Biblical Discernment Ministries (BDM) of Bruce Wilkinson.<br><br>
		As BDM notes, Mr. Wilkinson is just another hustler of the "name-and-claim-it" prosperity gospel – a <i>false</i> gospel.<br><br>
		Its wide appeal is squarely related to the unfortunate truth that too many Christians&nbsp; are spiritual infants looking for new milk formulas that will gratify their carnal lusts.&nbsp; False teachers 
		like Wilkinson will <i>always</i> be there to fill that need.<br><br>
		Sadly, James Dobson's endorsement of Wilkinson made him all the more popular.&nbsp; The fact that Mr. Wilkinson could fool so many in the churches and his heretical teachings not be instantly 
		recognized for what they are, should caution us against entertaining much hope for the church culture to say nothing of the culture in general.<br><br>
		The good news may perhaps be that he will help us recognize the broad nature of the evangelical Christian community in the United States: <i>
		False teachers galore</i>.<br><br>
		In his book, Wilkinson encourages the reader to recite a particular prayer every day for weeks.&nbsp; Jesus spoke of this kind of foolishness:<br>
		<blockquote>
			<i>But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</i> 
			– Matthew 6:7<br>
		</blockquote>
		And thusly, Wilkinson reduces Christian prayer to the babble of those who follow false gods. More unfortunate is the fact that few care.<br><br>
		This fiasco of false teaching can be partially attributed to an error in the translation of 1Chron. 4:9 into the English (it has not been corrected to my knowledge).<br><br>As anyone who knows 
		Hebrew will note, the verb “honor” (KBD) is conjugated as transitive (passive clause) and not in a linking manner. I.e. it should read “…was honored by [his] brothers” and not “…was [more] 
		honorable [than his] brothers”. The context is unknown.<br><br>It could mean he was better at raising goats and sheep.&nbsp; That is, he was respected/honored by his brothers not that he was more 
		honorable than they were. Mr. Wilkinson builds a huge (and false) case on a faulty translation of the passage.<sup>1</sup>
		<br><br>If he had done any research, the book might not have been written but you never know with the hucksters.&nbsp; Like Bill Bright, they will just make up stuff if it sounds good.<br><br>I am 
		still astounded that Multnomah (the publisher) let this slip by, including the Evangelical Publishers Association.&nbsp; Are all of these people so ignorant?&nbsp; So unlearned?&nbsp; Does anyone read 
		Hebrew?&nbsp; Does anyone in these organizations care about the truth?&nbsp; About accuracy?&nbsp; Apparently not.<br><br>God is not some genie that if we pester Him enough times and in a proper way, He will 
		give us our desires. Are we to pray like the pagans (Mt. 6:7)?&nbsp; Mr. Wilkinson, Multnomah, and the EPA think so.<br>

	<sup>1</sup>All translations of the Old Testament made during the Reformation relied on on the Septuagint, a translation of the Hebrew into Greek that was made in the 1st century B.C. The 
		translators made some mistakes and, thankfully, they are mostly obscure. Sadly, the Jabez passage used by Wilkinson has a critical error which, until that huckster appeared, was of no 
		importance to anyone.
