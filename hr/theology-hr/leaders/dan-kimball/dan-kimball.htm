	<h2>by Dan Kimball</h2>
	
	<p>Reviewed by Hadley Robinson</p>
		<p>Tackling ecclesiology head on, Dan Kimball exhorts the reader to practice some important paradigms of the quintessential church found throughout the ages.&nbsp; Among these are:&nbsp; 
		Bringing the Bible back into the Church; cultivating a church culture that encourages dialogue; ensuring that the gospel is allowed to do its work instead of the charismatic eloquence of the 
		preacher; and emphasizing that Jesus is the only way to God.<br><br>
		These are all stressed in the Holy Scriptures in one way or another.&nbsp; He also notes the exhortation of 1Corinthians 2:1-5 that the Cross of Jesus Christ – alone – should be preached 
		instead of the world’s wisdom.<br><br>
		Rather than focus clearly on the paradigms above, Mr. Kimball fills his book with desultory observations of our fickle culture and how Christians should respond to it.&nbsp; Reviewing 
		Kimball and others of his bent in Christianity Today, Andy Crouch stated, “They have confused style and substance.”&nbsp; Perhaps a better title for the book would be &nbsp;Christianity Can Be 
		Anything You Like!<br><br>
		The <span class="italics">Emerging Church</span> is not about repentance, the Cross, and its offense (and hope) to a fallen, sinful world but about buzzwords such as “postmodern” “seeker” 
		“emerging” “missional” “vintage” “deconstruction” etc.&nbsp; It’s also about cheerleaders in the church growth movement who clutter nearly every page with vapid balloon remarks that do little 
		to improve the book’s quality.<br><br>Rick Warren (a Protestant pope) writes the forward. &nbsp;Sadly, I am still trying to figure out what he is really saying after repeated re-readings.&nbsp; 
		Warren is a master of word “switcheroo” – using words in the postmodern way.&nbsp; This is where they are chosen for how they sound rather than for what they may mean.<br><br>The pop-Christian 
		writers cult has adopted a plethora of fancy-sounding words, like "missional" to tickle people's ears.&nbsp; For example, Mr. Warren writes (p. 7) that it’s OK to do anything in church worship 
		“…as long as the biblical message is unchanged.”&nbsp; This sounds good until you try to pin down what his “biblical message” really is.<br><br>
		Like Mr. Warren, Mr. Kimball appears to shop around for Bible paraphrases which suit his purposes.&nbsp; As a result, we are subjected to eisegesis: Where interpretation is read into the Bible 
		instead of out of it.&nbsp; Jesus said the way is narrow.&nbsp; For Warren et al., it is broad and getting broader, especially as his book sales continue to skyrocket.&nbsp; It’s all a 
		testimony to the sad state of the Church in our land that so many reject the simple teachings of the Bible for mere popular eloquence.&nbsp; <br><br>
		Kimball, in a switcheroo, exhorts us to carefully preach from the Bible (good) and then, elsewhere, he will prattle on about “seeker-sensitive” this or that.&nbsp; For example, on page 25 he 
		says
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Being seeker-sensitive as a lifestyle means that we are sensitive to spiritual seekers in all that we do. …it is a lifestyle approach to how we live as Christians in relation to being 
			sensitive to seekers of faith.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Instead of living to impress others, Scripture commands us to live a holy life, regardless of whether anyone wants to follow us or not.<br><br>
		It gets worse.&nbsp; On page 88, he writes, “We probably wouldn’t be attracted to Christianity if we weren’t Christians.”&nbsp; Or, on page 210 he writes, “…the tide will turn and 
		non-Christians will be drawn to us instead of being turned off by us.”<br><br>Contrary to the “gospel-lite” promoted by Kimball, Warren, and the other pop-gospel leaders of today, God’s word 
		tells us what turns off people from coming to Christ:&nbsp;no one seeks after God (Ro 3:10).&nbsp; It’s just that simple.<br><br>We do not need hundreds of pages telling us how 
		awful/insensitive/backward we Christians are and how we must atone for our sin of being unpopular with the pagan and immoral culture.&nbsp; Yet Kimball does note some of the greater errors of 
		church bureaucracies in the past that made the gospel look bad.&nbsp; He is to be commended for that.<br><br>
		What is surprising is that those in the church growth movement do not seem to pay any attention to the explosive growth of the gospel in places like Communist China:&nbsp; Where Christians 
		meet, love one another, hear the Word, and pray – as they have for thousands of years – largely without the videos, books, conferences, and mass marketing techniques employed here.<br><br>
		Jesus commanded that men repent and believe in Him.&nbsp; It was not an invitation.&nbsp; For that, they killed Him as it was not then – nor now – a popular message to sinful fallen mankind. 
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>“For we are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing; to the one an aroma from death to death, to the other an aroma from life to 
			life.” (2Co 2:15-16 NASB)</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Suffice it to say, no one comes to Christ for any reason other than the Father compels him (John 6:35ff.)&nbsp; Contrary to Kimball’s assertions, Jesus was not “seeker-sensitive" to those 
		with whom He can in contact with.&nbsp; In fact, Jesus usually did what He could to drive people away (Jn. 6:54ff). <br><br>
		Why all these pages that promote a candy-coated gospel?&nbsp; The answer is given in 2Tim. 4:3.
		
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p>For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their 
			itching ears want to hear.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Kimball needs to look again at his Bible, especially the parable of the sower and what happens to the seed that falls on the rocky ground:&nbsp; Shallow roots – shallow faith – falling 
		away.<br>
		<br>The feeding of the five thousand in John 6 would be another lesson for him to consider:&nbsp; The crowds wanted to fill their stomachs with food instead of with the body and blood of Jesus 
		Christ.&nbsp; The sacred text offers here one of the greatest un-revivals in history:&nbsp; Five thousand came and all but a dozen left.<br><br>
		Practically speaking, Kimball wants to return us to the Dark Ages when <a href="laybrinth-prayer-by-dan-kimball.pdf">superstition and hollow ritual</a> dominated the Church.&nbsp; This is not 
		progressive; it’s regressive.&nbsp; Rather than leaning on just another splintered reed, Christians should build their lives on the pure milk of the Word.<br><br>
		Kimball has it backward.&nbsp; Meetings of the Church are not about art, music, incense, candles, mood or experience.&nbsp; They should be about love for one another, holiness, and pure 
		doctrine undefiled by the wisdom of this world.
