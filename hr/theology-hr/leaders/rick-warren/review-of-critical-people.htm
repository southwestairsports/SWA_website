		<p>Mr. Warren’s essay <a href="CriticalPeople.htm">How to Deal with Critical People</a> in the October 2005 edition of The Ladies Home Journal is but another example of his rejection of 
		biblical truth.&nbsp; His audience of readers is primarily unsaved women – not those who know Christ.&nbsp; With this in mind, what godly advice should a pastor give to these women who seem to 
		be suffering from the criticism of others?&nbsp; The Bible has much to say on this matter but let’s first look at what he says.<br>&nbsp;<br>In general, he advises what to do when we receive 
		negative comments from others.&nbsp; He declares that 95% of the happiness we will experience in life comes from how we deal with other people.&nbsp; Warren then gives four principles for how 
		we, presumably, can be happy 95% of the time:<br>&nbsp;<br>The first principle is that we are to reject those who make negative comments about us.&nbsp; Or, in his words, it’s foolish to please 
		others as much as we can (“…you can’t please everyone.”)<br>&nbsp;<br>The second principle is that it should not matter what others think of us.&nbsp; Since happiness is the goal, “…you are as 
		happy as you choose to be.”&nbsp; Happiness, therefore, is a world that we create solely by and for ourselves.&nbsp; Because I am a “great person” (in his words), I don’t need to pay attention 
		to anyone else that thinks otherwise – they are wrong!&nbsp; Not only that, they are insecure.<br>&nbsp;<br>The third principle is that we should not exact revenge on those whom we perceive have 
		hurt us.<br>&nbsp;<br>The fourth principle is that we must believe and affirm what the Bible says about us, that we are “…lovable, capable, forgivable, acceptable, and valuable.”&nbsp; Furthermore, 
		the most important person in our life can influence our “self-image” and this is why we should be very careful about choosing who are friends are.&nbsp; He sums it up, “If God loves you, and 
		you love you, you don’t need the approval of un-pleasable people.”<br>&nbsp;<br>Of the four principles, only the third has any foundation in Scripture: We are never to exact revenge on others as 
		this is the exclusive prerogative of God (Ro 12:19).&nbsp; Mr. Warren is to be commended for giving at least one godly principle (which he appears to later reverse).&nbsp; But, what about the 
		other three?<br><br>As per the first, the rejection of those who are critical of us (ignoring them) assumes that they only want to hurt us – a false assumption.&nbsp; Even the unsaved may say 
		critical things to their children in an effort to improve their character, e.g., “You are looking for the easy why out of this problem rather than facing it squarely….”<br><br>Someone who is 
		engaging in drunkenness or gluttony does not want to hear the truth.&nbsp; What if Peter decided to follow his advice when the Lord rebuked him (Mt 16:23) and ignore Jesus’ words?&nbsp; The 
		same could be asked when Peter was rebuked by Paul for acceding to the false teachers in Antioch (Gal 2:11-14).&nbsp; Can anyone imagine how foolish Peter would have been to ignore the 
		criticism given in both instances?&nbsp; Surely Peter must have been hurt, but they were the blows of those who cared for him and, especially in the latter, those who cared how he influenced 
		others by his bad conduct.&nbsp; Contrary to Mr. Warren’s advice, the Bible says:<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The way of a fool seems right to him, but a wise man listens to advice.&nbsp; - Pr. 12:15</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Instead of ignoring those who are critical of us, we should carefully discern if what they are saying is right or not, even if they are an enemy and we are not saved men.&nbsp; Jesus, for 
		example, did this with the Pharisees who were certainly not friends of His.&nbsp; With this advice, Warren is appealing to our vanity, selfishness, and blindness.&nbsp; Instead of helping the 
		unsaved women who read The Ladies Home Journal, he is encouraging them to act like fools.<br>&nbsp;<br>As per the second principle, rejection of negative comments directed at us by others is not 
		another “principle” but an extrapolation of his first: Not only should we ignore those who are critical we should ignore what they say.<br><br>Rejecting/ignoring others (precisely what Warren 
		says we have to endure from others) is not the proper response.&nbsp; According to Warren, we are not to retaliate (principle #3).&nbsp; But, isn’t ignoring others simply to functionally 
		reject them?&nbsp; So, we are not to verbally reject (which is wrong) but we apparently can do it non-verbally.&nbsp; This is a fine distinction that doesn’t make a lot of sense.&nbsp; (But, 
		sadly, Mr. Warren says lots of things that sound good but don’t make any sense if you think about them for more than a minute or two.)<br>&nbsp;<br>It is also in his second principle that the 
		evidence of his mixing pagan psychology with the Christian faith comes fourth:&nbsp; “…you are as happy as you choose to be.”&nbsp; As if personal “happiness” is our goal in life or is even 
		obtainable.&nbsp; He is encouraging the wickedness condemned by the Prophets where people live for their own happiness apart from God:<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>But see, there is joy and revelry,… "Let us eat and drink," you say, "for tomorrow we die!" – Is 22:13</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The LORD responds to this sin of self-love and self-indulgence:<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>"Till your dying day this sin will not be atoned for," says the Lord, the LORD Almighty. – Is 22:14</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>It was unlikely that the hearers of the above were happy about it.&nbsp; As was the case with many godly prophets, the people not only ignored them (non-verbal rejection) but also put them 
		to death.&nbsp; God wants us to seek faithfulness, not happiness.<br>&nbsp;<br>The third principle – thankfully – gives us a brief interlude from gobbledygook.&nbsp; But shouldn’t we expect more 
		from the man who claims to be an evangelical Southern Baptist pastor and has changed forever the lives of so many millions on the planet?&nbsp; Who has a plan to eliminate poverty and AIDS in 
		Africa?<br>&nbsp;<br>The fourth principle he expounds has the most error and is a denial of what the Word of God says about all men without Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp; The unconverted man is not “lovable, 
		capable, forgivable, acceptable, and valuable.”&nbsp; The Bible says that:<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.&nbsp; “Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.&nbsp; The 
			poison of vipers is on their lips.&nbsp; Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness. Their feet are swift to shed blood; ruin and misery mark their ways, and the way of peace they do 
			not know.” – Ro 3:13-17</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>He has denied the gospel concerning those who reject it – the unconverted women who read the Journal.&nbsp; He appears to be (functionally) affirming universalism: That anyone can 
		experience a “95% happiness index” whether a child of God or not. &nbsp;He also once again affirms the popular narcissistic paradigm that we are to love ourselves.<br>&nbsp;<br>The First Commandment 
		demands there be no idolatry of any kind, including worship of one’s self.&nbsp; Jesus said we must hate ourselves – even our very lives – if we want to be His disciples (Luke 14:26).&nbsp; 
		Mr. Warren defies the clear teaching of Scripture that we can only experience real joy (not temporary “happiness”) if we belong to Christ:&nbsp; If we have repented of our sin and received 
		Him.<br>&nbsp;<br>
		He has done a disservice to Christ, His Church, and to the unsaved women who read The Ladies Home Journal.&nbsp; A great tragedy of our time is that so few have been discerning and even fewer 
		have made so little effort to test Mr. Warren’s words with God’s.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is no wonder that the average church is awash in various heresies including
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism">humanism</a>, rationalism, universalism and immorality.&nbsp; Pastors should be particularly aware because they are the shepherds who have 
		largely abandoned the spiritual health of their flocks in favor of people’s happiness and for bountiful congregations with the attendant influx of cash.&nbsp; The prophet Isaiah speaks of 
		these undiscerning shepherds who abandon His flock to the wolves:&nbsp;<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>They are dogs with mighty appetites;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they never have enough.<br>&nbsp; They are shepherds who lack understanding;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they all turn to their own 
			way,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each seeks his own gain. – Is 56:11<br><br>The shepherds are senseless<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and do not inquire of the LORD;<br>&nbsp; so they do not prosper<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			and all their flock is scattered. – Jer 10:21</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Mr. Warren and others have helped scatter the Church and, for this, they should be ashamed.&nbsp; The Christ of the Bible is the answer for all men of all time – hope is not to be found 
		anywhere or in anything else.<br>
