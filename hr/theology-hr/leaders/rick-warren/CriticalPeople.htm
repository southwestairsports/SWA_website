		Do other people's put-downs send you into a funk? These four insights will<br>get you on a new road to happiness.<br>&nbsp;<br>
		<span class="strong">Rejection by Others Causes Deep Mental Wounds</span><br>
		&nbsp;<br>You're going to be hurt by other people in life – that's a fact. And those<br>hurts leave scars that affect how you think, act, and relate to others. The<br>deepest wounds of all are 
		caused by rejection. Undoubtedly you've<br>experienced the pain of rejection in your life – from a parent, a spouse, a<br>friend, or even a stranger.<br><br>
		Sarcastic barbs, put-downs, belittling comments, criticism, gossip, and<br>
		ridicule are all potent weapons in the arsenal of rejection. For some of us,<br>when we're hurt, the tendency is to strike back, to exact revenge. But the<br>moment you retaliate, you give up 
		control of your life to the person who<br>angers and hurts you. "You make me so mad!" That is an admission of<br>control. What you are really saying is "You have power over me to<br>determine 
		how I feel."<br><br>Not all of us lash out when we're attacked. Some of us worry ourselves to<br>death with resentment. But nursing a grudge never hurts the other<br>person: It only hurts you.<br><br>
		So what should you do when you're under attack? Withdraw into a shell,<br>hide in a cave, isolate yourself from humanity and say, "I'll never let<br>another person hurt me again!" Definitely 
		not. You can make a different<br>choice. You can choose whether painful circumstances will devastate<br>you or direct you to a new path.<br><br>It's unavoidable: Dealing with other people 
		effectively is one of the most<br>important things you can learn in life. After you've mastered that, you're<br>about 95 percent down the road to finding happiness.<br>&nbsp;<br><span class="strong">
		How to Handle Put-Downs and Criticism</span><br>Remember, you can't please everyone.<br><br>Even God can't do that!<br>
		While some are praying for God to send rain, others are praying<br>for sunshine. It's foolish to attempt what even God can't do.<br>&nbsp;<br>
		<span class="strong">Realize that you don't need others' approval to be happy.</span><br><br>We live in a society where we don't get a whole lot of approval.<br>People do all sorts of crazy 
		things trying to win a smile from<br>someone too cold or nasty to ever give it. Remember, you are as<br>happy as you choose to be. So refuse to play the game! Don't<br>waste any energy trying 
		to convince un-pleasable, disapproving<br>people that you're a great person. The problem is not with you,<br>but with their own insecurities.<br>
		&nbsp;<br><span class="strong">Refuse to retaliate.</span><br><br>Striking back only lowers you to the naysayer's<br>level of immaturity. Instead, pray for that other person! It will help<br>both 
		of you. Be an actor, not a reactor.<br>&nbsp;<br>
		<span class="strong">Refocus on God's view of you.</span> &nbsp;<br><br>In the Bible we're told that God says you are lovable, capable, forgivable,<br>acceptable, and valuable. Now whom are you 
		going to believe?<br>I've talked with so many successful women and men who are<br>plagued with gnawing insecurity. Why? Because they are still<br>replaying hurtful statements made to them 
		years ago –<br>
		statements that weren't true even then. How do you erase those<br>tapes? By affirming what God says about you.<br>To a large degree your self-image is influenced by what you<br>believe the 
		most important person in your life thinks about you.<br>That's why choosing emotionally healthy friends is so important. It<br>is also why I recommend that you make God your best friend. If<br>
		God loves you, and you love you, you don't need the approval of<br>un-pleasable people.<br>&nbsp;<br>Rick Warren is the best-selling author of <span class="italics">The Purpose-Driven Life</span>.<br>
