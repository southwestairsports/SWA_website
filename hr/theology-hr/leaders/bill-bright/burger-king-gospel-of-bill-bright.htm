	<p>by Hadley Robinson</p>
	
	
		<p>The essence of syncretism with respect to worldviews (a.k.a religions) is to make the final product as palatable as possible to the average person of a particular culture.&nbsp; In other 
		words, if the locals are cannibals, say nothing about cannibalism.<br><br>If the locals love adultery and putting their wives away (a.k.a. divorce), say nothing about that.&nbsp; If the locals 
		tend to narcissism and self-love, say nothing about it.</p>
		<p>The worst thing one can do is to exhort the locals to deny themselves and take up their crosses.<br><br>This sort of thinking/evangelism gives us the "Burger-King" gospel – a gospel that we 
		can be mixed and matched, changed and modified, to whatever the hearers like.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bright, the founder of Campus Crusade for Christ, was a shrewd businessman.&nbsp; As Pastor James 
		Montgomery Boice 		<a href="j-m-boice.htm">
		quipped</a>, he was not, however, a theologian nor, as Dr. Boice also noted, a deep thinker.&nbsp; Translated:&nbsp; Bright took what he wanted from Scripture and invented the rest, borrowing 
		much from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_humanism">
		renaissance humanism</a>.&nbsp; What is worse, Bright, including Billy Graham and others, set the standard for other naive and ignorant persons on how to evangelize.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bright’s 
		<a href="the-four-spiritual-laws.pdf">Four Spiritual Laws</a> tract states ungodly principles not found in Scripture.&nbsp; Instead, the ubiquitous tract begins with a big “What’s in it for 
		me?”&nbsp; And on it goes.&nbsp; (Here is a more <a href="4Laws.htm">extensive analysis</a> 
		of the tract.)<br><br>But, some say, “So what?&nbsp; Millions and millions have come to Christ as a result of The Four Spiritual Laws.”&nbsp; But are the “millions and millions” really 
		Christians?</p>
		<p><span class="italics">Where is their fruit, especially in the U.S.A.?</span></p>
		<p>Galatians 5:19-21 defines what the fruit should be in a believer's life and it includes purity and chastity.&nbsp; Becoming a Christian can also mean bitter suffering in this life.&nbsp; But God forbid if we talk about that from today's pulpit.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, the Scriptures do not teach that everyone is an evangelist – a touchstone of the mass marketers.</p>
		<p>Americans have become so immoral as a whole that we have to endure debates on such heinous evils as partial birth abortion.</p>
		<p>Elected officials are vile because the people who elected them are vile.&nbsp; (We should stop all this endless criticism of legislators because they are simply the expression of the 
		electorate.)&nbsp; May God preserve and help us!&nbsp; But should we be surprised?</p>
		<p>The Apostle Paul asked that we pray for such deliverance from those in government who do not rule righteously:<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone– for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in 
			all godliness and holiness.&nbsp;1Tim. 2:1-2</blockquote>
		<p>For the most part, governments are run by the Prince of Darkness and do nothing but rob the people and persecute the righteous.</p>
		<p>So, where are Bright’s millions that he often boasted about?&nbsp; What is so difficult (impossible) for these millions to understand and condemn the evils of things like wife/husband 
		trading, sex galore outside of marriage, and abortion?<br>&nbsp;<br>The facts are that there are not “millions” of converts to Christianity because Bright preaches a false gospel and the fruits of 
		his tract are evident.&nbsp; Jesus spoke of these “converts” in Matthew 13:20-21:&nbsp;<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			"The one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.&nbsp; But since he has no root, he lasts only a short time. When trouble 
			or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away."</blockquote>
		In other words, the <span class="italics">what’s-in-it-for-me</span> 
		man has no true conversion – no hatred of his sinful, self-seeking nature which is at enmity towards God, no desire to repent of it, and no motivation to change his ways.&nbsp; So much for Bright's 
		millions....<br>
		<br>For the humanists and their theological relatives, everybody must be saved anyway, so why does repentance and holiness matter in the first place?&nbsp; The sacerdotalists rely on the prayer 
		formulas of others so they have little concern for possible errors that appear in Bright's feel-good marketing materials.&nbsp; Roman Catholics are not particularly moved by insipid theology 
		like Bright's, anyway.<br><br>
		Our LORD Jesus warned us about false Christians, gospel hypocrites, and how to discern who they are and what is their destiny,&nbsp;<br>
		<blockquote>
			Ye shall know them by their fruits. Matt. 7:16<br><br>Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door, you will stand outside knocking and pleading, "Sir, open the door for us."&nbsp; 
			But he will answer, "I don't know you or where you come from."&nbsp; Then you will say, "We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets."&nbsp; But he will reply, "I don't know you or 
			where you come from. Away from me, all you evildoers!" Luke 13:25-27</blockquote>
