			Dr. James M. Boice, pastor of Tenth Presbyterian Church (Philadelphia) and president of the Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals, in a recent interview with Christian News (12/97), 
		commented on Campus Crusade president Bill Bright as a signer of ECT (Evangelicals and Catholics Together) thusly:<blockquote>
				Bill Bright just isn't theological. He's a businessman. I don't think he knows any theology at all. And he's just out to 'evangelize the world.' Well, he's got these 'millions and 
				millions' who are becoming Christians because they've seen his 'Jesus' film. Well, Catholics want to do good things too, so Bill Bright doesn't really have any reason not to think that 
				Catholics are wonderful - co-belligerents, faithful soldiers of the Lord - and they believe in Jesus, right? Catholics believe in the 'Four Spiritual Laws' - that's fine with Bill 
				Bright. So he's with them - he doesn't think any deeper than that. But what has really disturbed us then, is somebody like J. I. Packer who has signed on [to ECT].... But Packer, 
				though a theologian, is ecumenical like Bright. Bright and Campus Crusade have worked closely with Catholics for years and welcomed them on staff.</blockquote>
