	<p>by Hadley Robinson</p>
	
	
		<blockquote>
			I believe in God the Father, Ruler of all, the Creator of Heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ his only Son our LORD; who was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of Mary the virgin.<br><br>
			He suffered under Pontius Pilate; was crucified; was dead, and was buried.&nbsp; He went to the realm of the dead; on the third day He rose from the dead.<br>
		<br>He ascended to heaven and sits at the right hand of God the Father almighty; from there he shall come to judge the living and the dead.<br>
		<br>I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy and universal Church, the fellowship of the godly, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life eternal.&nbsp; Amen.</blockquote>
		Notes:&nbsp; The Gk word "pantocrater" has traditionally been translated "Almighty." It is better translated "Ruler of All".&nbsp; The Gk word "hades" is translated as "hell" but this is not an accurate 
		translation in any version of English.&nbsp; Instead the Gk really means "realm of the dead".&nbsp; Any Greek speaking person of the first century knew this.&nbsp; The Gk word&nbsp; "catholic" that is translated 
		catholic really means "universal" in Greek.&nbsp; It has no particular association with the Church of Rome as this Greek word predates the Christian church. Traditions die hard....<br><br>
