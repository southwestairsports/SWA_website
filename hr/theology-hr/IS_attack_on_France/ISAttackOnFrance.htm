	<p>by Hadley Robinson</p>
	
	
		<p>I am so sorry for the mayhem that the IS created in Paris.&nbsp; The French are suffering so at this time.&nbsp; May the Holy Spirit be merciful and comfort those who have had their lives 
		turned upside down.<br>&nbsp;<br>Pasted below is the English version of the IS statement (from
		<a href="https://ent.siteintelgroup.com/Statements/is-claims-paris-attacks-warns-operation-is-first-of-the-storm.html">here</a>).&nbsp; Has anyone read the whole?<br>&nbsp;<br>If one considers how 
		many dedicated Communists it took to eventually overcome Czarist Russia (less than a dozen), it makes this statement worth a read.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note the absence of a fear of death and a 
		willingness to gladly die for the cause for which they fight.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sun Tzu, one of the greatest generals who ever lived (300 B.C.), commented in his “Art of War” that good military 
		strategy must avoid putting the opposing army in a corner because such men have nothing to lose and are the most ferocious fighters there are.&nbsp; “Give them the option of retreat…” Tzu 
		says.&nbsp; IS behaves like a cornered army.<br>&nbsp;<br>Meanwhile, the myth that Islam is peaceful continues to be spread by world leaders in the West.&nbsp; They have demonstrated that defending 
		socialist/humanist utopian dreams is more important than national security when the two are in conflict.<br>&nbsp;<br>IS particularly targeted the Bataclan concert hall.&nbsp; I wondered, “Why did 
		IS target this place?”&nbsp; What was going on there that was so offensive?<br>&nbsp;<br>I learned that it was not just some Joan Baez peacenik concert.&nbsp; It was a live performance by some 
		outfit called “Eagles of Death Metal.”&nbsp; Who are they?&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew I would likely have to go trolling through sewage to find out.&nbsp; So here goes….<br>&nbsp;<br>Here is the cover from 
		their latest album, “Zipper Down.” The album’s producer, Joshua Homme, wrote this trope promoting it, “…One should not zipper up, they should zipper down and let it all hang out.”&nbsp; No 
		doubt, a great majority here and in Europe wholeheartedly agree.</p>
		<p><img alt="Eagles of Death Metal lewd advertisement" class="auto-style1" height="425" src="EagleOfDeathMetalAlbum.jpg" width="425">&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Are Islamic State and a few others 
		among the miniscule that are offended by the lewd and vulgar culture in which we live?&nbsp;&nbsp; Could it be described as “…a profligate prostitution party?”<br>&nbsp;<br>It seems to be so….<br>&nbsp;<br>
		IS’s quote of Al-Hashr 2 echoed something found in the Bible, not surprisingly.&nbsp; Jeremiah 5:15-17,<br>&nbsp;<br>O house of Israel," declares the LORD, "I am bringing a distant nation against 
		you-- an ancient and enduring nation, a people whose language you do not know, whose speech you do not understand.&nbsp; Their quivers are like an open grave; all of them are mighty warriors.&nbsp; 
		They will devour your harvests and food, devour your sons and daughters; they will devour your flocks and herds, devour your vines and fig trees.&nbsp; With the sword they will destroy the 
		fortified cities in which you trust.<br>&nbsp;<br>Like the ancient Assyrians and Babylonians, has Islam and IS, in particular, been sent for a Divine purpose?&nbsp; Or, are they some manifestation 
		of random evil which we have to endure in a fallen world?&nbsp; With the former, we would end up fighting against God.&nbsp; With the latter, we are not fighting men, but an idea.&nbsp; If so, 
		how is that done?&nbsp; What defense can be plucked from the abyss of human decadence that is now the West?<br>&nbsp;<br>It is distressing that the highest Court in our land is content with the 
		state of our culture and does everything possible to drive it further into a bottomless Pit.&nbsp; Where will it all go?&nbsp; We are in the firm grip of the international Left which has 
		effectively suppressed any discussion of the alarming state of affairs we are in.&nbsp; Even so, it is difficult to have a dialogue with Hell….<br>&nbsp;<br>Islamic fighters are not easy to 
		suppress.&nbsp; It’s like getting rid of mushrooms in a manure pile by plucking them out.&nbsp; The next morning there are ten more…. <br>&nbsp;<br>Islamic State<br>France<br>Urgent: Statement 
		about the Blessed Paris Invasion on the French Crusaders<br>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful<br>The Almighty said: “And they thought that their fortresses would 
		defend them from Allah! But Allah's (Torment) reached them from a place whereof they expected it not, and He cast terror into their hearts so that they destroyed their own dwellings with their 
		own hands and the hands of the believers. Then take admonition, O you with eyes (to see).” [Al-Hashr: 2]<br>In a blessed attack for which Allah facilitated the causes for success, a faithful 
		group of the soldiers of the Caliphate, may Allah dignify it and make it victorious, launched out, targeting the capital of prostitution and obscenity, the carrier of the banner of the Cross 
		in Europe, Paris… Youths who divorced the world and went to their enemy seeking to be killed in the cause of Allah, in support of His religion and His Prophet, Allah’s peace and blessings be 
		upon him, and his charges, and to put the nose of His enemies in the ground. So they were honest with Allah, we consider them thusly, and Allah conquered through their hands and cast in the 
		hearts of the Crusaders horror in the middle of their land, where eight brothers wrapped in explosive belts and armed with machine rifles, targeted sites that were accurately chosen in the 
		heart of the capital of France, including the Stade de France during the match between the Crusader German and French teams, where the fool of France, Francois Hollande, was present.<br>[They 
		also targeted] the Bataclan Conference Center, where hundreds of apostates had gathered in a profligate prostitution party, and other areas in the 10th and 11th and 18th [arrondissements] and 
		in a coordinated fashion. So Paris shook under their feet, and its streets were tight upon them, and the result of the attacks was the death of no less than 100 Crusaders and the wounding of 
		more than those, and unto Allah is all praise and gratitude.<br>Allah had granted our brothers their wish and gave them what they loved, for they detonated their belts in the gatherings of the 
		disbelievers after running out of ammunition, we ask Allah to accept them among the martyrs and make us follow them.<br>Let France and those who walk in its path know that they will remain on 
		the top of the list of targets of the Islamic State, and that the smell of death will never leave their noses as long as they lead the convoy of the Crusader campaign, and dare to curse our 
		Prophet, Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him, and are proud of fighting Islam in France and striking the Muslims in the land of the Caliphate with their planes, which did not help them at 
		all in the streets of Paris and its rotten alleys. This attack is the first of the storm and a warning to those who wish to learn.<br>Allah is Great<br>“But honor, power and glory belong to 
		Allah, and to His Messenger (Muhammad), and to the believers, but the hypocrites know not.” [From Al-Munafiqun: 8]</p>
