		<i>This has been adapted with some comments of my own from Wenham’s and Heth’s Jesus and Divorce (Waynesboro, Georgia: Paternoster Press,&nbsp; 1984).&nbsp; It should be unnecessary but it must be noted 
		that there are rare exceptions where these four essentials could not be met e.g. if the parents or relatives are dead or unreachable, the couple is entirely alone, or the couple finds out that 
		consummation is physically impossible after they consider themselves married.&nbsp; Such a couple can still be considered married in the eyes of God and, less importantly, in the eyes of men.&nbsp; 
		However, a rape is always a rape no matter how it is dressed.</i><strong><br>
		<br>1.&nbsp; Intent and consent of the man and the woman</strong> – See Gen. 24:57-58; Song of Songs 1:15-16; Ruth 3-4; and Rom. 3:3-4.&nbsp; It is a binding covenant that is no more capable of being 
		broken than the covenant between Christ and the Israel of God, the Church.&nbsp; Adulterous behavior of one spouse no more annuls the marriage covenant than Israel’s spiritual adultery annulled her 
		covenant with God.&nbsp; The result of the union between the man and woman is that a new kinship or family unit is formed.&nbsp; (John the Baptist understood this which is why he referred to Herodias as 
		the wife of Herod’s brother, Philip, not Philip’s “ex-wife” – a modern invention created for the benefit of adulterers.)

		<blockquote>	[Marriage requires the]… intention of the parties to enter into a binding marital union and actual consummation.&nbsp; Neither the mere intention nor the sexual act was in itself 
			sufficient.&nbsp; Intention would be indicated by conduct such as courtship or by promises or other expressions aiming at an immediate union.<sup>1</sup></blockquote>
		
		<strong>2.&nbsp; Ratified by the parents</strong> – See Gen. 21:21, 34:4-6, 38:6 and Eph 6:1.&nbsp; This aspect is largely ignored by modern western cultures and the result is apparent.&nbsp; We are awash in 
		adultery and divorce resulting from, among other things, the immature and foolish decisions made by youths.&nbsp; The destruction of the family unit places unsustainable burdens on the culture at 
		large, especially the explosive growth in the population of undisciplined and violent young males.&nbsp; As De Tocqueville and others have observed, such cultures begin an inexorable and 
		irreversible descent into anarchy with resultant political tyranny.&nbsp; Without the permission of the parents, the new couple cannot expect God to bless the union.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the union is a 
		marriage.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br><strong>3.&nbsp; Ratified before witnesses</strong> – See Gen. 29:22 and John 2:1-11.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>4.&nbsp; Physically consummated</strong> – See Gen. 4:1, 29:21; Deut. 22:13; 
		1Sam. 1:19. The &nbsp;absence, however, of the fourth element does not make the betrothed woman anything less than a man’s wife (Deut. 22:23-24; Matt. 1:24-25).&nbsp; Consummation should eventually 
		occur as it is the duty and obligation of each.&nbsp; In fact, the husband and wife own each other’s bodies in a way that is entirely unique in the creation (1Cor. 7:4).&nbsp; Such is the extraordinary 
		bond between a man and his woman.&nbsp; If consummation cannot or does not occur, it is a lawful reason to annul the marriage – as if it had never been.&nbsp; The Church has always allowed this – that 
		there was never a marriage in the first place.<br>
		<br>The doctrine of the Church of Rome which teaches that Mary remained a virgin defies both Old and New Testament teachings on marriage.&nbsp; Joseph took Mary home to be his woman, i.e., his 
		wife, although he did not lie with her until Jesus had been born (Mt 1:24-25).&nbsp; That she would remain a virgin, though married to Joseph, would have been unthinkable to any godly Jew of the 
		time.&nbsp; Her body did not belong to her but to her husband.&nbsp; As a pious and godly woman, Mary would have lovingly and faithfully obliged her husband.&nbsp; Like Abraham and Sarah, Joseph and Mary are 
		our supreme examples of godly people.<br><br>If God had intended Mary to remain always a virgin, He would have rather placed her with relatives, for example, instead of with a man.&nbsp; What kind 
		of nonsense is it to suggest, as Athanasius did, that Mary was too pure to be an ordinary wife?&nbsp; <br><br>Joseph and Mary did not come together “…for a time” in obedience to 1Cor. 7:5 and 
		recorded in Matt. 1:24-25.&nbsp; Nonetheless, there is mystery here as to why God placed Jesus in a home consisting of a stepfather and mother.&nbsp; Why was she engaged to Joseph instead of a single 
		woman living with her parents?&nbsp; Was it because a single woman with a child would arouse great suspicion in the community concerning her morality?&nbsp; It is neither slanderous of Mary nor 
		blasphemous towards God to maintain that she was an ordinary married woman.&nbsp; It would only be so if, somehow, the consummation of a marriage is something impure or unclean as too many in the 
		4th century Church taught.&nbsp; The Word of God states unequivocally that the Creator was seeking godly offspring when He instituted marriage (Mal. 2:15).&nbsp; Jesus Christ is the arch-godly offspring 
		-- a man born of a woman.<br><br>Premarital sexual relations between a man and an unmarried and unbetrothed woman by itself does not make a marriage.&nbsp; This is discussed in Exod. 22:16-17 and 
		Deut. 22:28-29.&nbsp; Various things must happen:&nbsp; They must marry, the man must pay a fine if the father of the girl disapproves, and he cannot ever divorce the woman.&nbsp; Much of the teaching of the 
		Reformation in this matter is in error.&nbsp; As with parts of the Westminster Confession, legal fictions abound for the evil purposes of some in the Church to find excuses to dissolve a marriage.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>The point of the Scriptures above&nbsp;is that sexual relations alone do not make a marriage.&nbsp; This is also clear from the Old Testament distinction between a man’s concubines and his wives.&nbsp; 
		By implication, neither do sexual relations outside a marriage dissolve the marriage covenant/bond.&nbsp; Therefore, such passages as 1Cor. 6:15-18 must have 
		<a href="misuse-1corinthians6-16-17.htm">some other meaning</a> than the one popular with most Protestants:&nbsp; that extramarital sexual relations dissolves the original marriage.&nbsp; It does not 
		dissolve it but defiles it – the correct understanding of Deut. 24:4 and in line with the nature of God’s covenant with Israel.<br>
