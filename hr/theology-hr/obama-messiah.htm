		<p>The British have a way with words that it is unparalleled (see the editorial from The Daily Mail below).<br>&nbsp;<br>It is truly amazing the lack of sense among voters. The freight train of 
		homosexual marriage and abortion without limits (along with the well established banes of entrenched divorce and rampant adultery) will continue to roll along.&nbsp; Though Mr. Obama may not 
		have openly said he supports homosexual marriage, the overall goal of his supporters is the European model which is militant in its promotion.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, 1st and 2nd Amendment rights will 
		likely be curtailed or functionally adjudicated out of existence.<br><br>
		This citizen was incredulous listening to what people think Mr. Obama is going to do for them.&nbsp; Like the ambitious Emperor Nero of Rome (37- 68 AD), the new king of America is going to be 
		challenged in keeping true to his rhetoric without exacting a hefty price from those who can, want, and are able to take care of themselves.&nbsp; To be fair, it is not greatly different from 
		the previous administration that never met a spending bill it did not like and so racked up the national debt – and now the new régime wants to double it again.<br><br>In most ways, we have 
		become the Amorites noted in Genesis 15:16. Government is god – our hope, our future, our peace, our source of joy, our fountain of prosperity.&nbsp; (May He save all of the godly from the 
		wrath of the heathens for opposing this wicked paradigm.)<br><br>But lest we be angry or disappointed, the LORD’s hand is in every detail of what is going on at this moment in history, as the 
		Scriptures teach – and we can rejoice in that: “… thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.”&nbsp; We alone can no more change the direction of a nation than could the righteous King 
		Josiah (2Kings 22-23).<br>&nbsp; <br>On the other hand, if we are Humanists first and Christians second, it is quite another story. That is, if we believe that the kingdom of heaven is the 
		here and now and that the United States is some functional embodiment of this, we are most to be pitied as we have resoundingly lost the struggle for some return to godliness in the nation – a 
		struggle that has been ongoing for many decades.&nbsp; Americans are determined to be immoral and we will experience the wrath and judgment of God for this – just like other nations in the 
		past who have chosen to go down this path (Col. 3:5-6; Heb. 3:12ff).<br><br>The Church, as in 13th century Asia Minor, has assumed the habits of the heathens.&nbsp; She is largely 
		indistinguishable from the surrounding culture.&nbsp; In the superficial, she is the adorned Bride of Christ; in the essentials she has gone after her lovers and become an adulteress.&nbsp; 
		Like ancient Israel, she professes love for Christ but will not obey Him.&nbsp; It is every man for himself.&nbsp; Who is left to guard your virgin daughters or the purity of your sons?&nbsp; 
		As this author has experienced, the Church is as rife with the immoral as anywhere – it is business as usual....<br><br>LONDON DAILY MAIL editorial: On Obama's victory 1/6/2009<br>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Obama's Victory–A British view<br>&nbsp;<br>A victory for the hysterical Oprah Winfrey, the mad racist preacher Jeremiah Wright, the US mainstream media who abandoned any sense of 
			objectivity long ago, Europeans who despise America largely because they depend on her, comics who claim to be dangerous and fearless but would not dare attack genuinely powerful special 
			interest groups. A victory for Obama-worshippers everywhere. A victory for the cult of the cult. A man who has done little with his life but has written about his achievements as if he had 
			found the cure for cancer in between winning a marathon and building a nuclear reactor with his teeth. Victory for style over substance, hyperbole over history, rabble-raising over 
			reality.<br><br>A victory for Hollywood , the most dysfunctional community in the world. Victory for Streisand, Spielberg, Soros, Moore, and Sarandon. Victory for those who prefer welfare 
			to will and interference to independence. For those who settle for group think and herd mentality rather than those who fight for individual initiative and the right to be out of step with 
			meager political fashion.<br><br>Victory for a man who is no friend of freedom. He and his people have already stated that media has to be controlled so as to be balanced, without 
			realizing the extraordinary irony within that statement. Like most liberal zealots, the Obama worshippers constantly speak of Fox and Limbaugh, when the vast bulk of television stations 
			and newspapers are drastically liberal and anti-conservative. Senior Democrat Chuck Schumer said that just as pornography should be censored, so should talk radio. In other words, one of 
			the few free and open means of popular expression may well be cornered and eaten by bullies who even in triumph cannot tolerate any criticism and opposition. A victory for those who 
			believe the state is better qualified to raise children than the family, for those who prefer teachers' unions to teaching and for those who are naively convinced that if the West is 
			sufficiently weak towards its enemies, war and terror will dissolve as quickly as the tears on the face of a leftist celebrity. A victory for social democracy even after most of Europe has 
			come to the painful conclusion that social democracy leads to mediocrity, failure, unemployment, inflation, higher taxes and economic stagnation. A victory for intrusive lawyers, banal 
			sentimentalists, social extremists and urban snobs.<br><br>Congratulations America!</p>
