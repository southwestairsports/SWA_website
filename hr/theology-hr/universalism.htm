		There is an ongoing debate on this question amongst some Christians, including those outside of orthodoxy, but rarely are the roots of the controversy discussed.<br><br>
		Those who believe salvation is possible without hearing the Gospel (inclusivism or universalism) share worldviews that are not Christian.&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Kennedy gives a good summary of the issue
		<a href="http://standfirminfaith.com/?/sf/page/27307">here</a>.&nbsp; Defending Christian orthodoxy requires us to affirm that salvation without hearing the Gospel is impossible (exclusivism).<br><br>
		But those of us who are orthodox Christians (exclusivists) might ask what is the driving worldview behind the inclusivist view?&nbsp;<br><br>
		It might make this easier to understand if we consider that the Gospel preached by Paul is offensive – period:&nbsp; Christ crucified for sinners.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1Cor. 1-3 (among much other Scripture) makes 
		this case strongly.&nbsp; The basic offense of the Gospel will never sit well with inclusivists – it is so “unreasonable.”&nbsp; The “basic principles of this world” (of which we are to carefully guard 
		against being taken captive – see Col 2:8) can include a strong dose of
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism">humanism</a> (God wants me to be happy), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism">
		Egalitarianism</a> (men &amp; women are equal in every way), and Semi-Pelagianism/Arminianism (if I ought, I can).&nbsp; Inclusivists largely ascribe to the first and the third elements.&nbsp; I am 
		discovering that these three drive a significant amount of doctrine which, often enough, is beyond discussion, steeped as we are in a sort of intellectual torpor that often avoids the 
		difficult issues.&nbsp;<br><br>
		There are countless numbers of those who mix the Christian faith with all kinds of things, including the “isms” above.&nbsp; Sometimes, they are Humanists/Semi-Pelagians/Egalitarians first and 
		Christians (if at all) second.&nbsp; But we should expect this.&nbsp; The Reformation enshrined various “basic principles of this world” and it’s been a battle ever since.&nbsp; For example, over a thousand 
		years of Orthodox teaching concerning the permanency of marriage was thrown out because men wanted to put away a wife for one reason or another and marry someone else.&nbsp; My OT professor at 
		seminary (Walter Kaiser) has now fully embraced the egalitarian views concerning women’s roles &nbsp;in church – they can do anything a man can do – anything.&nbsp; That is, there is no difference 
		whatsoever in the potential roles of women and men.&nbsp; (I have always been puzzled why the NFL and the NHL do not have women’s divisions?&nbsp;&nbsp; But then who would watch teams play that are 
		inherently inferior?)<br><br>
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism">Egalitarianism</a>, for example, undercuts great swaths of Scripture, Genesis 2 in particular.&nbsp; 1Cor. 11:7; 14:34, and other New Testament 
		passages are summarily dismissed as cultural anachronisms.&nbsp; This might be easy to do on the surface.<br><br>The commands given by the Spirit for the Church in 1Cor., however, are not based on 
		some practice of Greek culture at the time but on the Creation.&nbsp; So, the Creation account in Genesis must become some mere poetic or vague picture of unknown events.&nbsp; Scripture, then, becomes 
		a house of cards that leaves the realm of reality and enters the shadowy world of intellectual abstraction – the faith of the majority of modern Protestant denominations.&nbsp; It becomes a 
		slippery slope – and most denominations have plunged down it in to heresy, including the denial that Christ physically rose from the dead.&nbsp; If Genesis and the book of Job are poetic devices 
		then why not the Resurrection?<br><br>
		We should not be surprised at what is going on in the churches because American culture vigorously embraces the three “isms” discussed here.<br><br>
		Is it possible to turn back in any of these areas, even in the Church?&nbsp; It is not likely.&nbsp; Public dialogue and practice in our nation has descended to levels unknown except by the most savage, 
		decadent, and immoral societies.<br><br>What aspect of homosexual “marriage” is anything but detestable?&nbsp; What stage of a partial birth abortion (or any abortion, for that matter) is not 
		utterly cruel and barbarous?&nbsp; Nations that sink to this level are capable of anything.&nbsp; If true Christians ever needed to be guarded concerning the signs of the times, it is now.&nbsp; Anything can 
		happen.&nbsp; But, like other similar times in history, they should expect to be slandered, expelled, shunned, and attacked – starting first in the churches.&nbsp; I have debated on occasion the reasons 
		from Scripture why suffrage should only be extended to men and those, in particular, who own real property.&nbsp; I have been amused at the incredulity expressed and I am thankful that I am only 
		written off as a crank or kook.<br><br>But those who discuss sexual intimacy between men receive approving nods and warm congratulations for their brave and progressive views.&nbsp; I can only 
		imagine that it was the same with the people when Aaron made the golden calf (Exodus 32).<br><br>
		The discussion about exclusivism and inclusivism will continue to rage.&nbsp; Women and men will continue to defy the Creation order and God’s purposes for them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Marriage between a man and a 
		woman for a lifetime will continue to be diluted and obscured.&nbsp;&nbsp; The State will continue to extend its overreach into human affairs.&nbsp; The notion that God wants me happy and prosperous will not 
		disappear until the world ends.&nbsp; Mass-marketing of a watered down Gospel will be endlessly popular.&nbsp; Success in the Church will be judged by numbers instead of the holiness of the people.&nbsp; The 
		feminization of congregations will roll forward like a locomotive. &nbsp;&nbsp;Americans will continue to put their young to death while in the womb. <br><br>
		Novelist Saul Bellow commented, 
		<blockquote>
			People don't realize how much they are in the grip of ideas. We live among ideas much more than we live in nature.</blockquote>
		He also noted that differing with prevailing views isn’t easy, “One toe out of line and you get clobbered.”<br><br>Moses understood this well while leading the Israelites – and was narrowly 
		stoned.&nbsp; It is similar today among Protestant evangelicals if one holds to some of the ancient and orthodox beliefs of the Church.&nbsp; Men will continue to make excuses for sin and justify evil 
		behavior.&nbsp; It is easy to do but wrong.<br><br>
