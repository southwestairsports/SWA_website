		<p>GMTC is one of the increasingly rare Evangelical Protestant organizations that actually presents a biblical Gospel.&nbsp; Most of these organizations all copy/read each other's material 
		with a simple criteria:&nbsp; If it sounds good, we'll use it.&nbsp; When Rick Warren came up with his blockbuster runaway best seller, "The Purpose Driven Life", other mass-marketers of the 
		Gospel often copied his paradigms along with his errors, mistakes, and misuse of Scripture.&nbsp; The most famous of these is Warren's out of context use of Jeremiah 29:11, a passage which has 
		nothing to do with Christians.&nbsp; Even organizations like Casas por Cristo use Warren's techniques for the likely reason that they were impressed how the money rolls in with Warren's 
		organization.&nbsp; Why not try his methods?</p>
		<p>Bill Bright's (Campus Crusade for Christ's) mass marketing approach is the most widely used:&nbsp; The "what's-in-it-for-me" gospel.&nbsp; That is, God has a wonderful plan for your life.&nbsp; 
		Bright and the rest of them do not tell anyone that God's "wonderful plan" can mean loss of one's possessions, physical torture, imprisonment, and/or death.&nbsp; This is the fraud of the 
		American mass marketers of the Gospel.&nbsp; Naturally, a false gospel in one way or another fills the churches with false Christians – the very ones mentioned in places like Matt. 13.</p>
