				<p>By Hadley Robinson with additional material by Duane Edward Spencer, Gerhard Kittel, and Steven Lawson</p>
				<p>There are at least seven important and distinct meanings of the word “world” used by John.&nbsp; The precise meaning of this word, as determined by the context, can be more evident 
				in one instance than in another.&nbsp; This is why interpreters should be diligent in looking at the entire Bible and not a single verse or section in order to make some theological 
				point.&nbsp; If this is not done, the Scriptures are bound to be misused.&nbsp; Some of the suggested meanings of the word "world" that are set out below may be open to discussion.&nbsp; 
				Greek is not a Romance language so we should expect that understanding it will take effort and care.</p>
				<ol>
<li>The created universe:&nbsp;"He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him." – Jn. 1:10; “Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were 
written down, I suppose that even the <span class="italics">whole world</span> would not have room for the books that would be written.” - Jn. 21:25; "Jesus said, 'My kingdom is not of this world. If 
it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But now my kingdom is from another place.'" – Jn. 18:36<br></li>
					<li>The earth itself:&nbsp; “As you sent me into the <span class="italics">world</span>, I have sent them into the 
					<span class="italics">world</span>.” – Jn. 17:18; "A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of 
					her joy that a child is born into the world." – Jn. 16:21<br>
					</li>
					<li>All men everywhere:&nbsp; “He was in the
					<span class="italics">world</span>, and though the <span class="italics">world</span> was made through him, the 
					<span class="italics">world</span> did not recognize him.” – Jn. 1:10;&nbsp; "When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never 
					walk in darkness, but will have the light of life." – Jn. 8:12<br>
					</li>
					<li>Mankind under the Creator’s judgment:&nbsp; “The 
					<span class="italics">world</span> cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that what it does is evil.” – Jn. 7:7; "Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, 'But, Lord, why 
					do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?'" – Jn. 14:22<br></li>
					<li>The public around Christ, in particular, the Jews:&nbsp; "'I have spoken openly to the world,' Jesus replied. 'I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews 
					come together. I said nothing in secret.'" – Jn. 18:20; "No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things, show yourself to the world." – 
					Jn. 7:4<br></li>
					<li>A large group within the whole Jewish community: “So the Pharisees said to one another, ‘See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the <span class="italics">whole world</span> 
					has gone after him!’” – Jn. 12:19<br></li>
					<li>The kingdom of evil forces, as related to the earth: "Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out." – Jn. 12:31; "Peace I leave 
					with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the <span class="italics">world</span> gives." – Jn. 14:27; “If you belonged to the
					<span class="italics">world</span>, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the 
					<span class="italics">world</span>, but I have chosen you out of the <span class="italics">world</span>. That is why the 
					<span class="italics">world</span> hates you.” – Jn. 15:19; “This is the victory that has overcome the 
					<span class="italics">world</span>, even our faith.” – 1Jn. 5:4; Also see Jn. 8:23; 14:30; 16:33<br></li>
					<li>The world of unbelievers, the non-elect: "The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that what it does is evil." – Jn. 7:7; "I pray for them. I am not praying 
					for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours." – Jn. 17:9<br></li>
					<li>God's elect among the Jews or those who consider themselves to be Jews: "The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, 'Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin 
					of the world!'" – Jn. 1:29; “They [the Samaritans] said to the woman, ‘We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this 
					man really is the Savior of the
					<span class="italics">world</span>.’” – Jn. 4:42.&nbsp; “For God so loved the <span class="italics">world</span> that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall 
					not perish but have eternal life” – Jn. 3:16.&nbsp; “I am the living bread that came down from heaven.&nbsp; If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which 
					I will give for the life of the <span class="italics">world</span>.” – Jn. 6:51; "I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to 
					me and they have obeyed your word." – Jn. 17:5<br></li>
					<li>God's elect of every tribe and nation, His chosen people, all true believers: "When he comes, he will convict the world of guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and 
					judgment" – Jn. 16:8; Jn. 1:29 might instead be this category, that is John the Baptist might have been thinking of all of God's chosen people, everywhere.</li>

		<p><span class="strong">A .&nbsp; John 3:16</span></p>
				<blockquote>
					For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.</blockquote>
				<p>There can be no other verse in recent times that is more often used out of context by American Evangelicals than this one.&nbsp; The object of God's intense, sacrificial love is 
				everybody, whoever lived, everywhere.&nbsp; With this misinterpretation comes a flood of other errors.</p>
				<p>This includes the common notion that if we dress up the Gospel in attractive clothing, men will "come to Christ."&nbsp; How is this done?&nbsp; As Bill Bright discovered, the 
				offense of the Gospel must be removed or suppressed, in particular we will drive men away if we tell them they are all lost and implacable sinners who must repent.&nbsp; "Repent and 
				believe in the crucified Christ" is just too negative.&nbsp; Instead of this simple Gospel which Paul preached, we must have tracts that flatter sinners and woo them into the Kingdom.</p>
				<p>That this is the exact opposite of what is taught in 1 Corinthians 1-2 does not seem to bother most.</p>
				<blockquote>When I came to you, brothers, I did not come with eloquence or superior wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God.&nbsp; For I resolved to know nothing while I was 
					with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. -- 1 Cor. 2:1-2</blockquote>
				<p>This attractive gospel has great appeal to the worldly man because it appeals to the flesh: "What's in it for me?"&nbsp; Why, it's easy: <a href="leaders/bill-bright/4Laws.htm">
				"Jesus has a wonderful plan for your life!"</a></p>
				<p>What follows is that the churches are filled with tares -- false believers -- who see the church and Christian faith as some type of loving self-help group where they can be 
				entertained by speeches and PowerPoint presentations presenting endless insipidity:&nbsp; "God loves you, I love you, we love you, you are wonderful, Jesus loves you..." and on and on.&nbsp; 
				The pastors become apologetic when they must read God's Word where the horrors of sin and its punishment are mentioned.&nbsp; The Gospel becomes emptied of its power. </p>
				<p>Meanwhile these people are trading spouses, right and left, living immorally and godlessly while the reproach that the true Christian must bear in the world increases.</p>
				<p>What follows next is that the unconverted move into leadership in the church.&nbsp; Then comes the heresy and apostasy without measure:&nbsp; Open adultery, immorality, and 
				homosexuality, in particular, and denial of the Resurrection, the bodily return of Christ, the substitutionary atonement, the Virgin Birth, the Judgment, et al.</p>
				<p>This is what happens when the meaning of "world" in John 3:16 is taken out of context and removed from any coherent biblical theology.&nbsp; Sad to say, coherent biblical theology 
				is largely missing from today's pulpits anyway....</p>
				<p>&nbsp;“World” in this verse must mean God's elect who are men from every tribe and nation but not all men from every tribe and nation, as per #7 above.&nbsp; It is more likely that Jesus 
				is referring to His elect among the Jews.&nbsp; The following passages help clarify this,</p>
				<blockquote>
					You did not choose me, but I chose you.... – Jn. 15:16<br>
					<br>No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me compels* him.... – Jn. 6:44<br>
					<br>...no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. – Lk. 10:22.</blockquote>
				<p>In John 3, Jesus meets with a leader of Israel who mistakenly believes that Jesus is from God because of the miracles that He does.&nbsp; Jesus corrects Nicodemus by saying that 
				only those who experience the work of the Holy Spirit (who are "born again") can perceive (see) His Kingdom and know that He is from God.</p>
				<p>Furthermore, He explains that this work of the Holy Spirit which converts men touches one but not another (it is like the wind).&nbsp; It is a sovereign work of grace that is not 
				available to all but only to those whom God loves (vs. 16) -- the world of His own to whom He proved that love by going to the Cross (John 13:1) for them.&nbsp; As all men are clearly 
				not saved in the end, God limited His love -- and His grace.&nbsp; This love is effective and accomplishes its purpose: to convert and so save some men.&nbsp; It is an irresistible 
				force that literally drags men into the Kingdom just as men are dragged into a court of law (John 6:44; James 2:6).</p>
				<p>This is echoed in the parable of the Great Banquet in Luke 14:23.&nbsp; Those invited wanted nothing to do with it.&nbsp; What was the Master to do?</p>
				<blockquote>Then the master told his servant, "Go out to the roads and country lanes and make them come in, so that my house will be full."</blockquote>
				<p>Jesus mentions this thread elsewhere,</p>
				<blockquote>For many are invited, but few are chosen. -- Mt 22:14</blockquote>
				<p>In the very next verse, the Pharisees -- the Semi-Pelagians of their time -- understood He was speaking of them.&nbsp; Their response illustrates that of the world to the 
				sovereignty of God's grace.</p>
				<blockquote>Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words. </blockquote>
				<p>If the correct context of John 3 is not carefully determined, this Scripture can become a source of much theological error that is in direct conflict with broad swaths of the Bible.&nbsp; 
				There is no hint that Jesus' concern is beyond His own people, the ones to which He came.&nbsp; He does discuss His "other sheep" but much later (John 10:16).&nbsp; "World" in vs. 16 
				is the world of His elect among His own people, in particular.</p>
				<blockquote>He came to that which was his own.... - John 1:11</blockquote>
				<p>Verse 17 helps clarify and establish the context of verse 16.</p>
				<blockquote>For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.</blockquote>
				<p>If Jesus was sent into the world to save every man who ever lived and will ever live, then God is a failure because most men reject the Gospel, some with vehemence.&nbsp; But if the 
				proper meaning of "world" is of #7 above, then both verses 16 and 17 make sense.</p>
				<p>The power of the blood of Jesus to effectively save when applied to a particular man achieves its goal, always saving the man.&nbsp; This was the case with men like Abraham, Lot, 
				Samson, and Jacob who were all distracted at various times by serious sin.&nbsp; Despite this, God's love for them would prevail and His purposes succeed.&nbsp; God is not a failure 
				nor does He need men's help.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, this is so because no one can boast as a result (1 Cor. 1-2).&nbsp; God alone gets the glory for the work done on the Cross, as He 
				should -- but not if one is an humanist or some variety of Pelagian.</p>
				<p>The error is in the understanding of the sufficiency of the blood of Christ versus its efficiency.&nbsp; If God loved everybody, would not He choose everybody?&nbsp; Does He love 
				those who belong to Him more than those who perish?&nbsp; Did He love Abraham more than the others among whom he lived?&nbsp; Though we do not know why, the answer must be “yes”.&nbsp; 
				If someone asks: <span class="italics">“...Then why does God still blame us?&nbsp; For who resists His will?”</span> Please see Ro 9:19ff.</p>
				<p>It is sad that major evangelists, like Bill Bright and Billy Graham, are careless with the Sacred Text.&nbsp; However, getting a following and building an empire appear to be too 
				difficult to resist.&nbsp; Changing the Gospel to make it attractive to the flesh must be done and so we have this ubiquitous misuse of this text in John.&nbsp; Few, if any, of the 
				American evangelists ask themselves, "What is the offense of the Cross?"</p>
				<p><span class="strong">B.&nbsp; 2 Peter 3:9</span></p>
				<blockquote>
					The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.</blockquote>
				<p>Although this verse does not concern the use of the word "world," it is still mistakenly used alongside of John 3:16 to be a sort of proof-text to assert that God loves the "whole 
				world," as it were.&nbsp; This passage, as well, is taken out of context to assert that God loves everybody, everywhere, whoever lived.</p>
				<p>If the epistle had been addressed to the “whole world” and not to just those who belong to Christ, then the Semi-Pelagian argument might stand.&nbsp; However, this is not the case:</p>
				<blockquote>
					...To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours.” – 1 Pet. 1:1</blockquote>
				<p>Therefore, the correct context is that the Lord does not want (and will not permit) any who are His to perish.&nbsp; This is in keeping with such statements of Jesus as in Jn. 6:39,</p>
				<blockquote>
					...I shall lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last day.</blockquote>
				<p>It is comforting to know that the saints will persevere through all troubles here and that we will never be the objects of His wrath.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile, too many teachers spread humanist (and anti-Christian) doctrine while demonstrating their lack of care in using the Scriptures.&nbsp; Universalism, Pelagianism, 
				Semi-Pelagianism, and Arminianism are not compatible with Christian orthodoxy.&nbsp; Their foundation is that man has a right to be happy and that he has enough good in him to chose 
				Christ.&nbsp; But this is not taught anywhere in the Scriptures.</p>
				<p><span class="auto-style1">*Nearly all English translations, including the KJV, translate the Greek as "draw" here.&nbsp; But this is not the accurate meaning of the Greek which, 
				without exception in usage, means an actor who applies an irresistible force to someone or something.&nbsp; It does not mean to "woo".&nbsp; Unfortunately in English, "draw" can both 
				mean to apply an irresistible force (e.g. draw water from a well) but also to "woo" or "entice".&nbsp; The Semi-Pelagians and other humanists are allowed to misuse the Scriptures in 
				this regard as they use it in the latter way.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, the rich do not woo or entice the godly into court -- they drag them (James 2:6).&nbsp; James uses the same Greek 
				word translated "draw" in John.&nbsp; Why "drag" here but not in John 6:44?&nbsp; It is yet another example of theological bias in the translations and another reason why all pastors 
				should be well acquainted with New Testament Greek.&nbsp; How else can they discover the theological bias and errors of the translation committees, among other things?&nbsp; It is 
				unfortunate that much of the theology of the Reformation was captured by the Humanists.</span><br>
