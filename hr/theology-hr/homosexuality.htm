	<h2>The final result of a godless &amp; morally bankrupt culture</h2>
	<p>by Hadley Robinson</p>
	
	
		<p>It should not be necessary to write about this disgusting subject but we must.</p>
		<blockquote>
			Vice is a monster of such frightful mien, as to be hated needs but to be seen. But seen too oft, familiar with her face, We first endure, then pity, and then embrace. - Alexander Pope<span class="auto-style1">1</span></blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			Suddenly so much filth. - Pope Benedict XVI when he first learned of the recent spate of attacks on young boys by homosexual priests.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them. - Romans 
			1:32</blockquote>
		<p>Homosexual behavior is becoming so widespread and popular that the remnant of the true and obedient Church must take action and clearly denounce this wholesale perversion of the Image of 
		Man and of human sexuality, in particular.</p>
		<p>The common ground of sexual perversion remains the same:&nbsp;sexual union in some manner that is in defiance of God's primary purpose for a man and a woman which is, as the Bible states, the 
		conception of human life.</p>
		<p>We should not be alarmed by the current crisis because rebellion and perversion are the signature characteristics of the human race and can appear at any moment in a culture.</p>
		<p>In the United States and elsewhere in the west more and more deviant behavior, such as homosexuality, is protected.&nbsp; Adultery, in the same manner, became a protected vice long ago -- 
		something no less detestable than homosexuality.&nbsp; Respectable people in our society routinely sleep with the wives or husbands of other men and women.</p>
		<p>A man cannot help who is parents are, his sex, his race, or the particular place and circumstances where he was born. But he can regulate his own behavior.&nbsp; Black men, feminists, and 
		now homosexuals are protected classes.&nbsp; They can be rude, slothful, arrogant, and engage in all sorts of vile behavior with impunity.&nbsp; But that is the goal of the Devil and his 
		followers of the Left, in particular: to regulate every aspect of human behavior and thought for evil.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, our Constitution gets thrashed by wicked judges who, in earlier times, would have been hanged, jailed, or deposed for their deeds.</p>
		<p>The U. S. has endured bitter cultural and political battles over the last century and a half.&nbsp; Citizens have voted their pocketbook and elected the worst sorts to office decade after 
		decade, accelerating the cultural spiral-dive.&nbsp; It is a pyrrhic victory for those who embrace decadence, depravity, vice, and greed because no civilization can withstand such deplorable 
		practices for long.</p>
		<p>For the electorate who put them there, they will be like the people who welcomed the Communist Revolution in Russia – out of the frying pan and into the fire. Decent people who remain here 
		will be subject, as they were in Nazi Germany, to increased ridicule, insult and persecution from criminals.&nbsp; This will be followed by property confiscation, attack, and incarceration.&nbsp; 
		Just as the Nazi Brownshirts did their work in the 1930's, so this cabal of perverse men do the work here under the ironic moniker of "Gay Power".&nbsp; Our military is used and abused for the 
		most questionable purposes – valiant fighting men who must face the throwing of their lives away for the whims of some ruthless gang of radicals elected by ignorant and senseless voters.&nbsp; 
		Good soldiers have to tolerate the presence of these perverts, including the feminists, the other grossly immoral, in their ranks.</p>
		<p>It is remarkable how quickly homoideology has taken over Western culture making such revolting practices and the men who do them somehow more acceptable.&nbsp; But we should not be 
		surprised.&nbsp; The foundations for this practice were laid down much earlier in the West's acceptance of contraception, abortion, adultery, and divorce in the early part of the 20th century.&nbsp; 
		We can look even further back to the Reformation when human happiness, rather than obedience to God and enduring the suffering it may require, was established as a worthy goal.&nbsp; (Here is 
		a <a href="errors-of-the-reformation.htm">discussion</a> of this issue.)&nbsp; Suffice it to say, the human sin nature has been around since the Beginning but the widespread public acceptance 
		of sexual sin in the West has been a more recent phenomena.</p>
		<p>The Church of Rome is reeling from homosexual predators among the clergy, especially among American Jesuits.&nbsp; According to some in the church, this sin is organized and present at all 
		levels, including the See at Rome.&nbsp; Pope Benedict XVI expressed alarm at the extent of the problem.&nbsp; Other godly clergy and laymen recognize that they have to clean house but will it 
		happen?</p>
		<blockquote>
			The Church has paid a very painful price for the tremendous offences [by homosexuals] which have been exposed, losing much of its credibility.&nbsp; ...The homosexual community in the Church 
			defends itself and is on the attack.&nbsp; ...We witness a terrible phenomenon – it turns out the comfort of homosexual offenders is more important than the fate of children and youth, the fate 
			of the whole Church. If that was done deliberately, that would be high treason, the Church would be guilty of betraying the youth!&nbsp; ...homosexuality is a wound on the personality which may 
			impair many other functions. Such impairments include distorted relationships with other men, women and children; the habit of constantly pretending, hiding something important in their 
			lives; the pattern of playing a game which prevents honest, deep, emotionally fair relationships with peers and tutors. It also hampers proper understanding and respect for the nature of 
			femininity and marriage as the mystery of the love between a man and a woman.&nbsp; ...In the USA, the priestly vocation is more and more often now called a gay profession.&nbsp; ...homosexual 
			relationships are a caricature of marriage.&nbsp; ...I learned about Bishop Paetz by accident, from a seminarian who told me, all trembling from emotions and terror, about his having been 
			molested by his own ordinary. He was at a brink of losing faith as well as mental and spiritual integrity. It was not an easy job to convince him that one man is not the whole Church, that 
			such case is yet another reason to become a priest so that something as wonderful as that is not left in the hands of such people.&nbsp; ...We must be prepared, and not be surprised even if we 
			are insulted with the worst curses, if we are accused of the worst things, for it is “out of the overflow of the heart that the mouth speaks” (cf. Matthew 12:34).&nbsp; ...The ardent work of a 
			multitude of decent parents, religious sisters, catechists, priests, bishops, is destroyed by the crimes of a group of vile men. &nbsp;– Fr. Dariusz Oko, Ph.D. (Here is the rest of this <a href="../theology-others/homoheresy.htm">
			excellent essay</a>.)</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			Yes, [homosexual abuse in the church] is a great crisis, we have to say that. It was upsetting for all of us. Suddenly so much filth. It was really almost like the crater of a volcano, out 
			of which suddenly a tremendous cloud of filth came, darkening and soiling everything, so that above all the priesthood suddenly seemed to be a place of shame and every priest was under the 
			suspicion of being one like that too.&nbsp; ...The greatest persecution of the Church comes not from her enemies without, but arises from sin within the Church.&nbsp; ...Pray for me, that I may not 
			flee for fear of the wolves. – Pope Benedict XVI</blockquote>
		<p>Is it not clear how much of this is going on in the Protestant denominations but it is more accepted.&nbsp; This is evidenced by openly homosexual bishops in the U.S. Episcopal church 
		(ECUSA).&nbsp; But Protestants are overcome with another problem among the laity and clergy alike:&nbsp; Adultery and divorce.&nbsp; While the unrepentant of this sin are less well organized, 
		the stigma associated with wife-trading is near zero in virtually all Protestant denominations.&nbsp; It is a regrettable state of affairs when sexual sin is allowed inside the Church.&nbsp; 
		The adulterous community in the Church also defends itself and is on the attack.&nbsp; Woe to him who stands up against the unrepentant adulterer in the Church.</p>
		<p>1Timothy 3:2 declares that only a one-woman-man (as the Greek expresses it) may be in a position of Church leadership.&nbsp; That this Scripture only refers to polygamy is the common but 
		incorrect view among most Protestants.&nbsp; Polygamy was illegal in the Roman world of the early 1st century but trading wives or having one after the other was as common as now.&nbsp; If a 
		man and his wife become one flesh – closer than any physical relation – how does that cease to be?&nbsp; How does one say to one's sister, "You are now not my sister."</p>
		<p>Sexual license among Christians has not always been so common.&nbsp; Scholarly commentaries on the Greek New Testament from 150 years ago went so far as to question the authenticity of 
		passages like Matt. 5:32 where Jesus allegedly allows divorce for reasons of infidelity.&nbsp; At that time in our church history, divorce was held to be a grave sin and detestable in God's 
		sight, as it should always be.</p>
		<p>Nowadays, adultery is a non-issue while the Church at large continues to get softer on other forms of immorality, including homosexuality.&nbsp; Some ask, "Is this the beginning of the end 
		of the world?"&nbsp; It is reasonable to wonder....</p>
		<p>1.&nbsp; <strong>Against Nature</strong>&nbsp; Male + male or female + female = sterile.&nbsp; The Creator made Man and the beasts male and female as stated in Genesis so that they may have 
		offspring after their kind.&nbsp; There are no hermaphroditic mammals.&nbsp; Homosexuality among animals is virtually non-existent because any tendency of this kind would end due to the 
		absence of offspring.&nbsp; This tells us something about homosexuality:&nbsp; it is based in unredeemed and evil human flesh.&nbsp; There is no more a genetic disposition to homosexuality 
		than there is to murder, lying, or stealing.</p>
		<p>2.&nbsp; <strong>Unlawful</strong>&nbsp; It is contrary to the Law of God.<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.&nbsp; – Leviticus 18:22 (c.f. 1Cor. 6:9)</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Many Protestants and some Roman Catholics adhere to the ancient heresy known as antinomianism.&nbsp; It claims that since Jesus fulfilled the Law and experienced the punishment for 
		disobeying it, we, as Christians, are no longer obliged to observe it.&nbsp; Accordingly, the practice of homosexuality, abortion, contraception, adultery, and divorce have become more and 
		more 
		<a href="antinomianism.htm">acceptable by Christians</a>.</p>
		<p>3.&nbsp; <strong>Result of Divine Judgment</strong>&nbsp; It is the final punishment of the flesh for those who are not thankful to God and deny His eternal power and divine nature (Romans 
		1:18-32).&nbsp; Men who practice this have a depraved mind.&nbsp; The Greek word for depraved is something that is unfit or fails to meet the test.&nbsp; An example of something depraved would 
		be counterfeit currency.&nbsp; It looks like the genuine thing but upon closer examination it proves to be useless and false.&nbsp; So are men who lust after each other:&nbsp; Useless and 
		false.</p>
		<p>4. <strong>No Place in the Kingdom</strong>&nbsp; Homosexuals have no place in God's Kingdom.<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual 
			offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. 1Corinthians 6:9-11</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Nowhere else in Scripture are the two kinds of homosexual men described, as here.&nbsp; Male prostitutes (the Greek word means "soft") are men who assume the function of women.&nbsp; 
		Homosexual offenders are those men who assume the male role with effeminate men.&nbsp; This evil was known and commonplace in the ancient world but the homosexual men of Paul's day were not 
		militant, not in control of the armed forces and the police, and not influential in the places of learning as they are in the United States.&nbsp; Is there truth in the claims of Islamic 
		priests that we are the Great Satan?&nbsp; One can only wonder how much worse the culture here can become....<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.&nbsp; – Revelation 22:15</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Per "the dogs", Jesus Christ is not referring to household pets.&nbsp; It is a Hebrew euphemism used to describe a homosexual man (Dt. 23:18).&nbsp; However, some translations, such as the 
		NIV, render it differently.</p>
		<p>We should note that adulterers and all the sexually immoral are lumped in with the practice of homosexuality.&nbsp; It must be said that the reference above (Rev.&nbsp;22:15) is referring to the 
		unrepentant – not the repentant (cf. 1Cor 6:11).</p>
		<p>The sin of homosexuality is so grievous in the Creator's sight that the men of Sodom were denied any grace that might have induced them to repent and be saved.<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the skies? No, you will go down to the depths. If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have 
			remained to this day. But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you." – Matthew 11:23-24</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>This is a double warning against the sin of homosexuality but also against unbelief.&nbsp; The implication here is that unrepentant homosexuals who had never heard the Gospel are at an 
		advantage to those who hear it but do not obey.&nbsp; As to what "more bearable" may mean is beyond the scope of this essay.</p>
		<p>Both the adulterer and the homosexual must repent of their sin.&nbsp; But what church in America does not permit adultery?&nbsp; Consequently, how can a church demand that homosexuals 
		repent and turn away from their wickedness?&nbsp; In any case, the worldwide rise of the homosexual movement is the LORD's doing and may be in preparation for the End.&nbsp; European states 
		are already persecuting anyone who dares to condemn this practice.&nbsp; A good example is the recent arrest of <a href="http://www.standfirminfaith.com/?/sf/page/30634">Tony Miano</a> in the 
		once Great Britain for calling homosexuality a sin and those who practice it, sinners.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.standfirminfaith.com/?/sf/page/30778">Similar events</a> are occurring here in 
		the United States.&nbsp; Most pastors are tripping over each other in the rush to embrace homosexuals.&nbsp; Why run afoul of the vile, the criminal, the detestable who have taken over the 
		government of the United States?<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>There will be terrible times in the last days. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, ...lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.&nbsp; 2 Timothy 3:1-2</p>
