		<p>America needs no words from me to see how your decision in Roe v. Wade has deformed a great nation.&nbsp; The so-called right to abortion has pitted mothers against their children and women 
		against men.&nbsp; It has sown violence and discord at the heart of the most intimate relationships.&nbsp; It has aggravated the derogation of the father’s role in an increasingly fatherless 
		society.&nbsp; It has portrayed the greatest of gifts — a child — as a competitor, an intrusion, and an inconvenience.&nbsp; It has nominally accorded mothers unfettered dominion over the 
		independent lives of their physically dependent sons and daughters.&nbsp; And, in granting this unconscionable power, it has exposed many women to unjust and selfish demands from their 
		husbands or other sexual partners.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;Human rights are not a privilege conferred by government.&nbsp; They are every human being’s entitlement by virtue of his humanity.&nbsp; The right to life does not depend, and must not be 
		declared to be contingent, on the pleasure of anyone else, not even a parent or a sovereign.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;<span class="italics">—&nbsp; From a brief filed by Mother Teresa February 1994 asking the Supreme Court to hear a case involving Alexander Loce, who was convicted of trespassing when he 
		tried to stop his fiancée from having an abortion.</span></p>
