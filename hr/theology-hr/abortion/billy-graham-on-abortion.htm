		Lunden: I think people are weighed down today too, don't you, by all the tremendous issues and all the decisions they have to make, and they look to people like you. I know the last time you 
		were on the show with Mike Schneider, he asked you what your position was on abortion, and you said, "There's a Christian position, but I can't say what that is." Can you say what that is now? 
		Have we come to some kind of a feeling?<br>
		<br>Rev. Graham: Well, I know what the Bible teaches, that, you know, Jeremiah was called of God before he was born, while he was in his mother's womb. And when Elizabeth was bearing in her 
		womb John the Baptist, Mary went over to see her, and the baby leaped in the womb of Elizabeth. So there is life at that point. And when it comes to abortion, that's a long story that in two 
		or three minutes I couldn't go into.<br><br>Lunden: Oh, I know.<br><br>Rev. Graham: But there are occasions, I think, when abortion is the only alternative.</p>
