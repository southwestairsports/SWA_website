		<span class="strong">Abortion</span> – The shedding of innocent blood as a result of sexual wantonness with an utter disregard of the purpose of human sexuality.&nbsp; A nation that permits 
		abortion can permit anything, however barbaric and cruel.&nbsp; China, Vietnam, and Russia, like the U.S., also have no limits on when and how an abortion is performed.&nbsp; How tragic that we share 
		such a legacy with nations that are among the most violent in history.&nbsp; <br><br>
		<span class="strong">Albert Mohler</span> – On the 30th anniversary of the Supreme Court's infamous decision, Dr. Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, wrote an 
		<a href="albert-mohler-on-abortion.htm">essay</a> on how the American elite who inherited a Christian civilization have been ransacking the culture for decades.&nbsp; The abortion decision by the 
		Court was just one more result of this cultural erosion.<br><br>
		<span class="strong">Billy Graham</span> – During an 
		<a href="billy-graham-on-abortion.htm">interview</a> by Joan Lunden on Good Morning America Sept. 19, 1991, Mr. Graham not only waffled (again) concerning abortion but gave the anti-Christian 
		bigots of the cultural elite a powerful weapon to help shatter the unity of the churches involved in the fight to end the mass killings.&nbsp; Mr. Graham – without qualification – stated that 
		abortion may be necessary on occasion.&nbsp; If the venerable Dr. Graham thinks abortion is necessary, it must be.&nbsp; It is tragic that a national Christian leader like Mr. Graham was incapable of 
		giving a Christian position on abortion.&nbsp; Glib statements of his like, "...I came to preach the gospel, not abortion" demonstrate that his "gospel" is some other gospel.&nbsp; It is because of 
		immorality, abortion, and a host of other sin that Jesus Christ had to die – that we would need the Gospel in the first place.<br><br>
		<span class="strong">Mother Teresa</span> – She filed
		<a href="mother-teresa-on-abortion.htm">
		this brief</a> with the Supreme Court asking that they protect the rights of a father who was arrested attempting to stop the killing of his unborn child.&nbsp; "America needs no words from 
		me...."&nbsp; The Court, of course, refused to review the case – another pyrrhic victory for the feminists and the emasculated.<br><br>
		<span class="strong">Paul Greenberg</span> of the Weekly Standard comments on the evils spread by the abortion mentality: The
		<a href="paul-greenberg-on-abortion.htm">
		Culture of Death</a>.<br><br>
		<span class="strong">Sydna Maas</span> shares how she recovered from the horror on an abortion:&nbsp;
		<a href="sydna-maas-on-abortion.htm">
		Breaking Sexual Soul Ties</a>.&nbsp; Every woman should read this deeply personal journey of someone who overcame the nightmare of guilt that often overwhelms those who have killed their own 
		children.<br>
