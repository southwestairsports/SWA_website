		This epitaph, carved in stone, is on display at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London, England.&nbsp; It is from the chapel built in 1756 by George Whitefield, the great evangelist, and was located 
		on Totten ham Court Road (west side), the City of London.&nbsp; The chapel was rebuilt in 1899 because of foundation problems and was completely destroyed by a German flying bomb in 1945.&nbsp; At the 
		time of its destruction, the chapel could seat over 1,200 people.<br><br>Would that such Christian love among siblings be more commonplace.&nbsp; Smallpox raged around the world for millennia and 
		either killed tens of millions of people or severely crippled, disfigured, and/or blinded them.&nbsp; The lesson here should be:&nbsp; Be thankful for the many blessings we have.&nbsp; God is so good to us 
		these days that humanity no longer suffers from this terrible scourge.&nbsp; - Hadley Robinson A.D. 1994<br><br>&nbsp;<br>
		<span class="italics">Erected by a Sister in Memory of her beloved ANNA CECILIA, daughter of CHRISTOPHER RHODES, Esq; of Chatham in the County of Kent.&nbsp; She departed this life June 2d. 1796, 
		age 32.&nbsp; Her Remains were deposited in the 42d. Vault of this Chapel.&nbsp; Distinguished by a fine Understanding and most amiable Disposition of Heart, She was the Delight of her Parents, and the 
		Admiration of all who knew her.&nbsp; At the Age of 17, the Small-pox stripped off all the Bloom of youthful beauty, and being followed by a dreadful Nervous-disorder, withered those fair Prospects 
		of earthly Happiness which were expected from her uncommon Affection, Sensibility and Tenderness.&nbsp; After enduring this afflictive Dispensation many Years, when it was difficult to say which 
		exceeded, her Sufferings or her Submissions; her Friends Concern for her Sorrows, or their Admiration of her Patience; She was released by Death, and received into that World where there shall 
		be no more Pain.&nbsp; But GOD himself shall wipe away Tears from every Eye.&nbsp;<br></span>&nbsp;<span class="italics"><br>Alas!&nbsp; How vain are feeble Words to tell<br>What once she was, and why I lov’d so 
		well;<br>
		None else but he who form’d the Heart can know<br>How great her Worth, or how extreme my Woe!<br>Blest Calv’ry, on thy crimson Top I see,<br>
		Suff’rings and Death, with Life and Love agree;<br>Justice severe and smiling Mercy join,<br>And thro’ the Gloom we see the Glory shine.</span><br>
