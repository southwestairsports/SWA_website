<meta name="description" content="What is the gospel of Jesus Christ?  How has modern evangelical Protestant teaching distorted and  
diluted it?   It is characterized by a general lack of scholarship, accountability, and faithfulness to the Scriptures.  As a result, church 
leadership has become increasingly dominated by those who promote themselves rather than selflessly shepherd the flock.  Immorality 
among Christians has become epidemic, aided by some unique doctrines of the Reformation.  Christians imagine that marriage can be dissolved 
by things other than the death of a spouse so that they can remarry another.  What is Islam and why has God allowed this religion to spread?"/>
