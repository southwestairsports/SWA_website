		Instructions:<br />
				<br />
					1. If you have done 
					anything bad or are a mental case, you cannot legally 
					possess a firearm. If you are unsure what 
					&quot;bad&quot; means, read the instructions for this form
		<a href="http://www.atf.gov/files/forms/download/atf-f-4473-1.pdf">here</a>.<br />
				<br />
					2. We can receive weapons from anywhere/anyone in the United 
					States.<br />
				<br />
					3. Handguns should be shipped UPS or FEDEX 2nd day air or USPS Priority 
					Mail.&nbsp; Rifles may be shipped by any means.&nbsp; Be 
		sure to insure any shipments!<br />
				<br />
					4. If you purchase a weapon over the Internet and the seller 
					is a federally licensed dealer (like us), he will request our license 
					details. We take care of that. All we need is his email 
					address (preferably) or FAX number. All other types only 
					need our address to be in compliance with the law. We can 
					still send them our paperwork, if they desire.<br />
				<br />
					5. When we receive the weapon, we will contact you right away. 
					Then a.) You may come to our premises, b.) Pay for the weapon or 
					pay the transfer fee, 
					c.) Complete the
					<a href="http://www.atf.gov/files/forms/download/atf-f-4473-1.pdf">
					required paperwork</a> (it must be done at our premises), d.) Get approved to receive a firearm by the FBI. 
					e.) Only 
					then can you leave with your weapon(s).&nbsp; f.) If it 
					applies, active-duty fighting men who are not Texas residents must 
					furnish us a copy of their orders stationing them at Ft. 
					Bliss.<br />

				</span>Yankees, leftists, socialists, communists, feminists, 
				<span title="">androgynous</span> perverts, 
				welfare or drug addicts, most Democrats and other enemies of the U.S. 
				Constitution, decent society, and hard working, moral people who make all nations successful for the long haul.&nbsp; 
				Death is better than dishonor -- at least real men have that in 
				common with Islam.<br />
				<br /><br /><strong>Speaking Truth<br />
				<br />
				</strong>&quot;Speaking truth in times of universal deceit is a revolutionary 
			act.&quot; - George Orwell&nbsp; &quot;We live in a time of universal deceit.&quot; - Mad Had</p>
				<p class="auto-style9">&quot;People don't realize how much they are in the grip of ideas. We live among ideas much more than we live in nature.&quot; - Saul Bellow<br />
				</p>
				<p class="auto-style9">&quot;...destructive and irresponsible freedom 
				has been granted boundless space [in the U.S.]. Society has 
				turned out to have scarce defense against the abyss of human 
				decadence, for example against the misuse of liberty for moral 
				violence against young people, such as motion pictures full of 
				pornography, crime, and horror.&quot; - A. Solzhenitsyn<br />
				<br />
				The Founding Fathers &quot;There is not one out of ten high officials 
				in the three branches of the Federal Government who would not be deposed, jailed, or hanged by the Founders of the United States.&nbsp; 
				Whose side are you on?&quot; - Mad Had<br /><br />Yankee Imperialism: &quot;People have a right to their own culture, 
				including the Yankees, but it is wrong to force it on others.&nbsp; 
				This is why wars start.&nbsp; Just listen to the Mexicans.&nbsp; Until the Yankees go home and stay 
				there, there will be no peace, especially in the Western 
				Hemisphere.&quot; - Mad Had<br /><br />
				Women running the Show
				&quot;The U.S. Congress and the Executive are governed by a majority 
				of women -- at least that is how they act.&nbsp; But these days, 
				you really don't know unless you do a DNA test.&quot;&nbsp; - Mad Had<br />
				<br />Yankee Nazis&nbsp;
				&quot;If they are extreme conservatives, they have no 
				place in the state of New York.&quot;&nbsp; - 
				New York governor Andrew Cuomo.&nbsp; Who are &quot;they&quot;? Semi-auto 
				gun owners, pro-lifers, pro-heterosexual marriage people, and 
				other God-fearing folk.&nbsp; Mr. Cuomo:&nbsp; Before you spoke 
				the words, I did not 
				want a place in your Nazi-style state.&nbsp; 
				Furthermore, you 
				and your Yankee friends have no place in Texas or any other 
				Southern state.&nbsp; If the reader of this has the misfortune to live in Yankee-land and are 
				a &quot;they&quot;, we Texans welcome you.&nbsp; Emigrate ASAP.&nbsp; 
				You will be glad you did.&nbsp; For those who remain, we all 
				wish you the best but you are swimming upstream in filth.<br /><br />Gun Rights &quot;Only because we have gun rights has it prevented 
				the U.S. from becoming a vast concentration camp.&quot; - Ground Zero 
				radio show<br /><br />When Women Run Things&nbsp;
				&quot;In large parts of the country, especially the left-coast and 
				the northeast, men look like women and women look like men.&nbsp; 
				When women run things, this is what happens.&nbsp; 
				We in the South and those in most of the world consider this 
				a perversion.&quot;&nbsp; - Mad Had<br /><br />Yankee Intolerance
				&quot;Most Democrats, leftists, liberals, Europeans, and Yankees are like the 
				Nazis or the Pharisees -- arrogant, intolerant, blind, want to 
				take over the world, and think they are doing a 
				service to humanity.&nbsp; Like Stalin, they won't quit their 
				dirty work no matter how bad things get.&nbsp; Meanwhile they 
				will do all they can to silence and destroy good people.&nbsp; This 
				is a character problem 
				which is not fixable by an peaceful means.&quot; - Mad Had<br />
				<br />Lazy Americans
				&quot;If you don't have a job, get one.&nbsp; Meanwhile, don't 
				sit around living off the labors of others.&nbsp; You can pick up trash from 
				the public highways.&nbsp; At least you are doing something for 
				the common good.&quot;&nbsp; - Mad Had<br /><br />Democrat Thieves&nbsp;
				&quot;The Democrat party is stealing this country.&nbsp; They are doing it by making 
				voters out of millions of ignorant, slavish people who refuse to 
				take care of themselves or act responsibly.&nbsp; They collect free medical benefits and other sorts of welfare 
				that must be paid for by the rest of us.&nbsp; Many of them are here illegally, 
				and barely speak English, if at all.&nbsp; 
				They know little about our Constitution, political 
				freedom, respect for law, and personal and financial responsibility.&nbsp; 
				Worst of all, the illegal immigrants import the bankrupt cultures of the 
				places they left.&nbsp; If this continues, 
				we will all be reduced to paupers and servants of the Democrat 
				party thugs and the crony capitalists, neither of whom care much about the U.S. middle 
				class.&nbsp; Nonetheless, there are those who want to emigrate here and 
				become good citizens but the Democrats keep them out.&quot; - Mad Had<br />
				<br />A Job for the Military
				&quot;When are the mid-level officers of the U.S. military going to do 
				their job and defend the 
				U.S. Constitution from domestic enemies -- the thieves, political radicals, hippies, and 
				dope heads who have seized our government, especially those in the Federal 
				Judiciary?&quot; - Mad Had<br /><br />Yankee Underhandedness:&nbsp; Yankees defend and protect evil 
				behavior by encouraging non-whites to play the 'race-card'.&nbsp; It is one of the tools 
				that they use to attack their enemies and divide 
				people.&quot;&nbsp; - Mad Had<br /><br />Bankrupt Cultures
				&quot;Good men who happen to be black are confronted by a white 
				culture that is becoming as bankrupt as their own.&nbsp; Is it 
				any wonder that more and more of them embrace Islam?&quot; - Mad Had<br />
				<br />Rights for Soldiers
				&quot;If a man is old enough to carry a machinegun, fight Muslim 
				terrorists somewhere in the world, and face the prospect of getting 
				maimed or killed doing it, he 
				is old enough to own a pistol and drink a beer.&nbsp; But until 
				women (and men who act like women) are stopped from running the country, this is not going to 
				change.&quot; - Mad Had<br /><br />A Feminist Lesbian Speaks Out
				&quot;If civilization had been left in female hands, we would still 
				be living in grass huts.&quot; - Feminist &amp; Lesbian Camille Paglia<br />
				<br />Black Culture
				&quot;Black culture throughout the world is one of the most depraved 
				and bankrupt the world has known.&nbsp; How can anyone celebrate 
				welfare dependency, debauchery, drug use, and personal 
				irresponsibility? Ninety percent of all American blacks are born out of 
				wedlock. &nbsp;If you are a black man, you need 
				to abandon your cultural heritage.&nbsp; Anything is better, 
				including Islam.&quot; - Mad 
				Had<br /><br />The Myth of Freedom of Speech &quot;Yankees will claim they believe in 'freedom of speech' -- 
				but only as long as it agrees with their own.&quot;&nbsp; - Mad Had<br />
				<br />Bad Bugs Running the Show &quot;State and Federal capitals attract 
				bad men in the same 
				way honey does flies.&nbsp; Now we have a fly problem with bugs 
				that have their hands on superior deadly force.&nbsp; This is a 
				serious crisis for all good citizens. &quot; - Mad Had<br />
				<br />Snowball headed for Hell&nbsp; &quot;Are we rolling down hill like a snowball headed for Hell?&nbsp; 
				With no kind of chance for the Flag or the Liberty Bell?&quot; - 
				Merle Haggard - Are The Good Times Really Over? Lyrics<br />
				<br />Senseless Voters
				&quot;American voters, the majority of which are women, have shown year after year that they 
				lack any sense.&nbsp; How can this be fixed?&nbsp; How do you 
				fix a nation full of women who think Ellen deGenerate is some 
				sort of role-model?&nbsp; How do you fix a culture of death?&quot; - Mad Had<br />
				<br />Bad Men
				&quot;There are bad black men.&nbsp; There are bad white, Latin, and 
				Asian men.&nbsp; Bad men are everywhere.&nbsp; But this is lost 
				on the racist legislation against whites that Yankees and their collaborators 
				have forced on us and the legal system.&quot;&nbsp; - Mad Had<br />
				<br />The Innocent Must Pay&nbsp;
				&quot;One of the Yankee beliefs is that the descendants of 
				bad men must pay for the crimes of the dead.&nbsp; This and a 
				host of other evils have made Americans as a whole hated by good men 
				everywhere in the world.&quot; - Mad Had<br /><br />Leave Us Alone&nbsp; &quot;Muslims and most other non-Yankees have this in common: they want to 
				be left alone.&nbsp; But the Yankee, their inner-city 
				slavish dependents, and the crony-capitalist fascist types will do anything, 
				including use deadly force, to press on with their goal of 
				world cultural domination.&nbsp; Hillary Clinton, has made 
				this clear.&quot; - Mad Had<br /><br />Yankee Definition of Freedom &quot;When the Yankee speaks of 
				'freedom' he does not mean freedom from political and cultural tyranny but 
				freedom to engage in all sorts of vice and criminal schemes, the 
				goals of the latter being to rob one man of the fruit of his labors and 
				hand it over to another.&nbsp; These snakes, like the 
				Soviets, spend their time misusing the language in order to make 
				criminal activity sound good.&nbsp; Like the current President, 
				they are talkers and deceivers and have the ability to back it 
				all up with the use of deadly force.&nbsp; The Founding Fathers 
				and other good citizens would label them as brutal tyrants.&quot; - 
				Mad Had<br />
