	<p>All training is 100% dependent on weather conditions. Before coming out, check your email 
	and the web site to be sure training is not canceled.&nbsp; If something 
	comes up, we will attempt to contact scheduled pilots.&nbsp; We usually train at
	<a href="http://www.southwestairsports.com/SiteInfo/SodFarm/sodfarmdirections.htm">
	sod farm #4</a>.&nbsp; Training times can vary because of weather or equipment 
	issues.&nbsp; Pilots can 
	always arrive earlier than the scheduled times to setup and practice kiting.</p>

	Geographic website.&nbsp; <a href="https://youtu.be/E-7AAoFron8">Fly like a bird</a>!</p>
	<p>Most countries love adventure sports like hang gliding and paragliding.&nbsp; Switzerland, for example, even put an <a href="SiteInfo/Swiss50Franc.jpg">image of a guy paragliding</a> on their 50 Franc note.&nbsp; The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 
	has opened the doors of Texas parks to USHPA pilots.&nbsp; Other public land administrators in the U.S. should do the same.</p>
	<h3>Recent Events</h3>
	<h4>June 10-11 Saturday - Sunday -- PPG training at the sod farms</h4>
	<p>These two days were some of the best air we have had for training pilots in months.&nbsp; At dawn on both mornings, the winds were steady, averaging about 7 mph until late morning on Saturday 
	and mid-morning on Sunday.&nbsp; The sky cover Saturday gave us many hours to tow pilots up and for them to test their skills doing reverse inflations without being towed up.</p>
	<p>Pilots Jason Tilley, Ken Hunkus, Heather Coulon, and Doak Hoover (help only) came out near dawn to practice. L-R: Jason, Ken, Heather, Doak, Marilyn &amp; Had Robinson.&nbsp; Marilyn is expert the 
	ATV rider who finds the drogue parachute and returns it to launch with the tow line so pilots can fly!</p>
	<p><img alt="paragliding at the sod farms, Santa Teresa, NM" height="771" src="06-12a.JPG" width="1028"></p>
	<p>Foot launching with a paramotor takes more skill than launching without because of the weight, noise, and dynamic forces needed to leave the earth.&nbsp; If winds are calm, pilots must do 
	one of the hardest feats in paragliding -- a forward inflation.&nbsp; It is so difficult because you cannot see the glider during the most important times of the inflation.&nbsp; Pilots were 
	instructed to launch and land as many times as possible while doing benign maneuvers while in the air including big ears, 360 degree turns, flying a course, keeping a constant altitude, and 
	learning to land in strong conditions.</p>
	<p>These two days marked the first independent powered flights for Ken and Heather.&nbsp; Jason continued his training on forward inflations in weak conditions.&nbsp; All pilots saw how much the winds can vary in strength and 
	direction off the earth's surface.&nbsp; Everyone successfully completed his PPG2 rating from the <a href="http://www.usppa.org/">USPPA</a>.&nbsp; Congratulations pilots!</p>
	<p>Heather and Ken (background) getting geared up at dawn for 3 hours of training -- about all anyone can do.</p>
	<p><img alt="paragliding at the sod farms, Santa Teresa, NM" height="960" src="06-12b.JPG" width="1280"></p>
	<p>Ken ready to launch by tow his first PPG flight.&nbsp; I will tow him high in the air, he will release from tow, and then start his engine.&nbsp; Getting towed up takes nearly 100% of the risk 
	when launching with an engine -- because it is off.&nbsp; Ken's first flight was perfect, thanks to the requirement that all pilots must first learn to safely fly a paraglider before adding the 
	complexity of powered flight. The next day, Ken completed his first powered flight independent of the tow system.&nbsp; What this means is that a pilot must launch under his own power -- always 
	daunting the first time anyone does it.</p>
	<p><img alt="paragliding at the sod farms, Santa Teresa, NM" height="960" src="06-12c.JPG" width="1280"></p>
	<p>A long distance photo of Heather getting towed up sans engine for a practice flight.&nbsp; She was over 500' high when I snapped this photo.</p>

	<p>Jason doing a reverse inflation.&nbsp; His engine is running but he must first make certain that the glider is stable and directly overhead.&nbsp; In a moment he will rotate 180 degrees, move 
	forward, and go to full power in a few seconds.&nbsp; This rotation must be done quickly because once facing forward, a pilot loses most visibility of his wing and has to guide it largely by feel.</p>
	<p><img alt="paragliding at the sod farms, Santa Teresa, NM" height="960" src="06-12e.JPG" width="1280"></p>
	<h4>June 4 Saturday -- Sod farms -- training</h4>
	<p>Saturday afternoon was perfect for advanced training in PPG and, near dusk, for a <a href="http://southwestairsports.com/training/pg-tuition/pg-tuition.htm">Discovery Flight</a>.&nbsp; For the 
	former, we had Jason Tilley and for the latter, a new trainee, Daniel Beauchamp.&nbsp; Jason was learning the complex technique needed to launch a paraglider with an engine.&nbsp; There are about 
	(8) things that must be done at the same time and why flying a paraglider really well requires hundreds of hour practice.&nbsp; The magic moment for good paraglider pilots who begin using an 
	engine to launch is when the throttle becomes second nature.&nbsp; The winds were about 9-12 mph most of the afternoon and allowed him to do a reverse launch (face the wing, bring it up, and then 
	turn and go).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I (Had Robinson) required him to as many launches and landings as he could do that afternoon.</p>
	<p>Jason just got his glider up, stabilized, and is turning CCW to begin his (successful) launch run.&nbsp; There is a LOT going on just at this moment.</p>

	<p><img alt="paragliding at the sod farms in Santa Teresa, NM" height="960" src="06-04c.JPG" width="1280"></p>
	<p>Daniel landed at dusk.&nbsp; The reason for giving student pilots their first flight near/at dusk is because that is when the atmosphere calms down and presents the most pleasant air for those 
	who have never flown a paraglider before.&nbsp; CONGRATS and GOOD WORK for your first solo paraglider flight!</p>

	<h4>May 30 Monday -- Ft Smith, AR -- Endless Foot Drag</h4>
	<p>Family and other matters prevented me (Had Robinson) from spending the Memorial Day weekend at the EFD but I was able to drop in on Monday around noon.&nbsp; As it turned out, everybody bailed 
	but Aaron Butler (our newest PPG instructor in Oklahoma and a former student of mine) and a friend.&nbsp; This was mostly due to the weather which was rain and lots of it.&nbsp; Thanks to my handy 
	Radar Scope smart phone app, I was able to determine where the dangerous weather was (far from Ft Smith) and have a few flights at the massive expanse of sod farms that are free of irrigation 
	equipment.</p>
	<p>The blurry dot in the photo is a rain drop on the lens of my camera.&nbsp; When is it too wet to fly?&nbsp; It's pretty simple: If your clothing is getting wet and staying wet, so is your 
	glider and it is not a good idea to be in the air.&nbsp; A wet glider behaves dramatically different than when it's dry -- greatly increased stall speed, in particular.&nbsp; Those who have been 
	caught in weather know the feel of a wet glider.&nbsp; As I was flying around, I was just on the border of getting wet.&nbsp; With humidity at 100% and the temperature in the upper 70's, it was 
	very pleasant.&nbsp; As the afternoon went on, the rain increased and I began to get wet -- time to land.</p>
	<p><img alt="paragliding at the sod farms Ft Smith, AR" height="960" src="05-30a.JPG" width="1280"></p>
	<p>There is one word to describe Ft Smith at this time: soggy.&nbsp; The Arkansas River (photo below) was near flood stage.&nbsp; Another 5' higher it would have covered the sod farms.&nbsp; It 
	was an experience for us desert dwellers to visit "soggy"....</p>
	<p><img alt="paragliding at the sod farms Ft Smith, AR" height="960" src="05-30b.JPG" width="1280"></p>
	<h4></h4>
	<h4>May 28 Saturday -- NE Oklahoma -- Thermalling</h4>
	<p>We have been on the road visiting family and hoping to spend some time at the <a href="http://rvppg.com/Fly-In/fly-in.html">Endless Foot Drag</a> hosted by Britton Shaw in Fort Smith, AR.&nbsp; 
	This region does not have many places to foot launch a paraglider or hang glider except one spot in southeastern OK (Buffalo Mtn) and a few spots in central Arkansas.&nbsp; If you want to thermal 
	XC, for example, you will have to motor up, as I did, cut the power, and enjoy!</p>
	<p>The advantage of PPG is that you can fly anywhere without having to be towed up or find some hill to jump off of.&nbsp; Another nice feature is that if you muff-up by picking the wrong cloud or 
	ground trigger, you are not forced to land and start over.&nbsp; You just say, "Oh well" and motor off to find another and try it.&nbsp; The disadvantage is stuff on your back.&nbsp; I really 
	don't like the motor there when I am thermalling but it is better than NOT thermalling.&nbsp; It does take some getting used to.&nbsp; Another downside is that you get sloppy because you know you 
	won't sink out!&nbsp; Remember also that if you DO THIS, your motor frame cannot take the jolts that an ordinary PG harness can take.&nbsp; This means that you should not fly in really active air 
	because you might break something on your frame.&nbsp; (I've already done that once.)</p>
	<p>It was fun looking for thermals late in the day.&nbsp; None of the clouds had sharp edges (very active thermals) so it was hard to find clouds (tops of thermals) that were not barely going up 
	(&lt;200'/min) but really going up (&gt;500'/min).&nbsp; The one in the photo below was a modest sucking machine.&nbsp; It has been many months since I have felt the powerful smooth lift below a cloud.&nbsp; 
	I am right next to the main cloud.&nbsp; Little stuff was forming to my left as I was going along.&nbsp; Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/7SHkMVRUXnE">30 second video</a> of some of the 
	journey.</p>
	<p><img alt="thermalling in a paraglider over NE Oklahoma in late May" height="960" src="05-28a.JPG" width="1280"></p>
	<h4>May 20-21 Friday Saturday -- Benito Juarez Stadium, Juarez City, Chih., Mexico</h4>
	<p>Jose Mu&ntilde;oz, Daniel Rivera, &amp; I (Had Robinson) were commissioned to do an aerial show and drop over the 2nd Division National Soccer Championship being held in Juarez Saturday night.&nbsp; 
	This would be a challenging event - flying low over 22,000 soccer fans during an historic match in a stadium that is less than a hundred yards from an international border.&nbsp; The morning 
	before the game, I was able to fly into and around the stadium, something I have never done.&nbsp; In most of the world, getting an aircraft near or over crowds is completely illegal -- but we had 
	permission.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, when doing things that are normally completely illegal, you can't have enough permission!&nbsp; In this regard, I was a bit nervous.&nbsp; The good news is 
	that we had 100% permission to do whatever was necessary from the U.S. authorities in case of a mishap e.g. having to do an emergency landing on the U.S. side.&nbsp; We made sure that any show we 
	would do would be a surprise as ultralight anything is never guaranteed because of any number of things, especially weather.&nbsp; Gusting was forecast for the afternoon which made me yet more 
	nervous.</p>
	<p><img alt="Benito Juarez Stadium, Juarez City, Chih., Mexico" height="1280" src="05-21a.JPG" width="1173"></p>
	<p>The owners of Los Bravos (the Juarez team), the Soccer Federation, and other authorities know basically nothing about aviation.&nbsp; If we are going to fly over the event, we must have access 
	to the site and time to practice.&nbsp; This is critical for safety.&nbsp; Because of pre-game activities, we only had about 30 minutes for a preflight.&nbsp; I was able to do a practice run but 
	no one else was able.&nbsp; On top of this, we were not allowed to be in the air except minutes before our show.&nbsp; The show consisted of a low flying smoke display, the dropping of about 30 
	Los Bravos mascots (small stuffed toy mustangs) and my landing midfield, donning a mustang custom, and hailing the crowd.</p>
	<p>When the time came to go, it was canceled at the last minute.&nbsp; I was not disappointed!&nbsp; I was thinking that dropping these mascots into the crowd (they did have little parachutes) 
	might have started fights and a riot, hence the possibility that we might have to flee for our lives....&nbsp; Who wants to make the news?&nbsp; Dealing with huge crowds of very excited people 
	requires careful planning -- for their safety and ours.&nbsp; All in all it was a great learning experience that, with careful advanced preparation and, especially, informing the authorities of 
	our precise needs would make a future air show of this type a success.&nbsp; More good news was that we were paid anyway (it is legal for us to fly for $$$ in Mexico but not in the U.S.)&nbsp; On 
	top of this, Los Bravos won the match and have now been placed in the 1st Soccer Division in Mexico!&nbsp; Also, learning how to deploy smoke grenades in the air without blowing ourselves up was 
	useful.&nbsp; I will post instructions on this site soon about how it should be done.</p>
