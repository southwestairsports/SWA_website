	<h1>SIV clinics</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>I&nbsp; recommend that all pilots attend an SIV clinic periodically.&nbsp; A pilot needs to learn how to control his glider in various situations that might occur during flight.&nbsp; Among 
	these are wing-tip folds, frontal collapses, and major asymmetric collapses.&nbsp; Pilots can practice wingovers, full stalls, extreme pitch and roll maneuvers, and reserve deployments at these 
	clinics.&nbsp; In 
	the event of a mishap, everything is safely done over the water, for the most part. </p>
	<p>Pilots of all skill levels can participate, including P1's with just an 
	hour or two of airtime.&nbsp; It is a modest investment for valuable training.</p>
	<p>However, the dangers of SIV clinics can sometimes outweigh the benefits.&nbsp; The following can occur at clinics not run by the best instructors and crew:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Drowning</li>
		<li>Becoming cocooned in the glider and then falling, resulting in death.&nbsp; The water will not help.</li>
		<li>A reserve deployment with the pilot drifting, out of control, into dangerous territory.</li>
		<li>Getting towed into other pilots or objects.</li>
		<li>Getting caught in hazardous weather.</li>
		<li>Becoming badly frightened, enough so that you quit the sport.</li>
		<li>Watching others get injured or killed.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Pilots must thoroughly research the parties running the SIV.&nbsp; There have been needless deaths and accidents at too many clinics due to poor instruction and a lack of concern for safety.</p>
	<p>It might be safest to get over to Europe for an SIV if you have any doubts about the operators of these events here in the United States.&nbsp; I know instructors in the U.S. who are very good 
	and care about pilot safety but they do not host clinics in our region of southern New Mexico and west Texas.</p>
	<p>Please <a href="../../ContactUs/contactus.htm">contact us</a> for more information on SIV clinics and where you can 
	take them.</p>
