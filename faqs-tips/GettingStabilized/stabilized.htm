	<h1>Stabilizing a Paraglider at Launch while Doing a Reverse Inflation</h1>
		<p>A new pilot tries his first go of a reverse inflation.&nbsp; It is an 
		interesting sequence of how he gets his glider up.&nbsp; Learning to fly 
		is by making mistakes and then correcting them  –  while safely on the 
		ground.<br>The pilot begins his reverse inflation by holding the inside 
		A lines in his left hand and the D lines in his right. (If you turn to 
		the right, you will hold the A lines in the right hand and the D lines 
		in the left.)&nbsp; The secrets are: 1.) ALWAYS be centered underneath 
		the glider which requires QUICK footwork.&nbsp; This is the MOST 
		important because directing the glider using the lines does not work 
		well when the pilot is on the ground and the glider is lightly loaded 
		with air moving relatively slowly across it.&nbsp; 2.)&nbsp; The A lines 
		accelerate the glider and D lines slow it down.&nbsp; The glider has 
		MOMENTUM so slowly release the appropriate set of lines as the glider 
		comes into the correct position.&nbsp; 3.)&nbsp; The risers should be 
		released once the glider is overhead.&nbsp; From then on, steer the 
		glider with the brakes.&nbsp; Remember that ALL INPUTS must be slow and 
		deliberate.&nbsp; It always takes a few seconds for the glider to 
		respond.&nbsp; Throughout this sequence pay close attention to the 
		pilot's hand positions.&nbsp; The glider does precisely what the pilot 
		tells it to do.</p>

	<p>The glider comes up nicely  –  as all the new ones do.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, he held on to the A lines too long and the glider shot too 
	far over his head and begins a frontal collapse.&nbsp; Fortunately, just as 
	if here were in the air, he keeps moving forward.&nbsp; The glider will 
	recover safely from the collapse.</p>

	<p>The glider falls behind and dives to the left because the pilot has too 
	much brake on that side  –  notice the position of his left hand.</p>

	<p>With the help of the instructor, the pilot raises his left hand and 
	brings down his right and the glider begins to stabilize in the proper 
	position over his head.</p>

	<p>He continues to move forward.&nbsp; We will not pull him up off the 
	ground until the glider is properly overhead and perpendicular to the 
	direction of launch.&nbsp; We always want the pilot to have a few seconds of 
	continued moving forward on the ground with everything ready to go.</p>

	<p>It all looks good  –  so up he goes!&nbsp; The beauty of towing is that 
	pilots can make all sorts of mistakes while they are safely on the ground 
	and thus learn how to safely launch and fly.&nbsp; It is not so once the 
	pilot leaves the ground.&nbsp; Improper handling of the wing while in the 
	air is much more risky.</p>
