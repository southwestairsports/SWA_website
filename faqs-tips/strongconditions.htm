	<h1>Launching and Flying in Strong Conditions</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
		<p>We do NOT want to learn about flying conditions in the manner that 
		these two pilots here learned.&nbsp; Read this a couple of times and say 
		to yourself, <span class="italics">“I will NOT launch without carefully 
		checking the weather.&nbsp; If I am uncomfortable with conditions, I 
		will NOT launch.”</span>&nbsp; It is not worth the possible 
		consequences.&nbsp; Also read <a href="SafeFlying/safeflying.htm">Tips 
		on Safe Flying</a>.&nbsp;  –  Had</p>
	<p>Jerry’s Story (from a post on Trikes_and_Flykes on yahoogroups.com)</p>
	<blockquote class="italics">
		If I may share a story with you that I'll never forget that taught me 
		more than any book or video or instructor could have.</blockquote>
	<blockquote class="italics">
		I had been free flying paragliders for about 5 years and had a P3 
		rating. One day I went to a ridge in the Bay Area after work to do some 
		ridge soaring and a local site I flew regularly. The wind was rowdy and 
		a bit gusty, but I was compelled to fly that day. I launched and had 
		about 1/2 hour of trashy air and it was progressively getting worse. 
		Unfortunately, I waited too long to get out of the air. When I top 
		landed a nasty a** gust re-inflated the canopy before I had a chance to 
		gain control of it after top landing, turning around and dropping it on 
		the ground. The gust re-inflated it and started dragging me, it 
		accelerated and I couldn't even pull in one side of the canopy to gain 
		control over it. It was accelerating me faster and faster dragging me 
		across the rocks and through the bushes until it ultimately slammed me 
		into a barbed wire fence. My leg was first to contact the fence and the 
		T-post brutally cut clean through both the tibia and fibula of my right 
		leg, as the canopy then drug (sic) me across the top strand of the 
		barbed wire fence shredding my back and legs in the process. I ended up 
		face down in the dirt on the other side of the fence. The leg from the 
		knee down was lying nearly parallel to my upper leg with blood squirting 
		all over. The only thing holding my leg onto my body was the calf 
		muscle. Fortunately, there were witnesses to the accident and the EMT's 
		got me off the ridge and to the hospital. They thought the leg would 
		need to be amputated but gave it a chance. Well, long story short, about 
		a year later I was able to find a mountain down in Bakersfield and took 
		my first free flight after the incident.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote class="italics">
		&nbsp;I learned a lot from that mistake in "judgment" and I paid dearly for 
		it. Lesson learned: Don't fly if unsure of the weather or if the wind is 
		too strong, too gusty, or too thermic. I would venture to say the 
		majority of PG and PPG accidents are the result of poor pilot judgment 
		or pilot error. Be careful and always listen to your "inner-voice".</blockquote>
	<p>Some more comments on the above by another pilot, Greg B.</p>
	<blockquote class="italics">
		Not as scary as Jerry's but still very fresh in my memory is a similar 
		free flight incident I had about a month ago.</blockquote>
	<blockquote class="italics">
		I launched in 15-18 MPH wind at a ridge/thermal site and quickly went to 
		about 1500 feet above launch in thermals. When it looked like I couldn't 
		descend by leaving lift (it was everywhere) I decided to come back down 
		in big ears and worked my way back to a top landing. Now the winds were 
		gusting over 20mph. I pulled big ears again to land and let them out 
		(probably not evenly) when I was a few inches above the ground. This 
		caused me to be lifted sideways and slammed into the ground. I was 
		lifted, dragged and dropped three times before a friend came and jumped 
		on top of my lines. I was able to walk away (with various pains) and the 
		doctor said I was very lucky that nothing was broken (I went to get 
		checked the next day.) My helmet was cracked in 6 or 7 places and the 
		horrible crunching noise in my neck during the incident left me with 
		strained muscles, etc. Various cuts, scrapes, and deep tissue bruises 
		were all along my right side. My right little finger had a cut almost to 
		the bone from a brake line I tried to grab to bring the wing down from 
		one side.</blockquote>
	<h2>Lesson 1</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;Do not fly in conditions above your skill level and recognize 
	what that skill level is.</p>
	<h2>&nbsp;Lesson 2</h2>
	<p>Practice various methods to quickly kill 
	the wing and ALWAYS be ready to use them when launching or landing. Kiting 
	practice is a great time to do this. Also practice forward kiting and 
	turning around/killing the wing from that position with the Bs and Cs, 
	asymmetrically or otherwise.</p>
	<h2>Lesson 3</h2>
	<p>Wear gloves!&nbsp; You will surely injure your hands from a line cut if you do NOT wear gloves.&nbsp; The best kind are leather because leather will not burn through like fabric-type gloves if 
	a fine glider line is pulled across the palm of the glove.</p>
	<p>Note: Ground handling is probably not as crucial to a quad/trike pilot, although 
	landing in high winds that have come up after you launched may call upon 
	skills that you have learned by kiting. Kiting also makes you familiar with 
	the flight characteristics of your wing, and subtle control you may need, 
	even in normal flight.</p>
	<p>Fly safely!</p>
