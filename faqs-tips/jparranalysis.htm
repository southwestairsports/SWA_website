	<h1>Analysis of Joe Parr’s Accident at Valle de Bravo</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>All of us in the paragliding community are extremely thankful to Joe 
			for making this video available.&nbsp; It is one of the best teaching tools we have to help us all fly more safely.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Did not operate within the limitations of his personal skills 
			and knowledge:&nbsp; “[Sharon] is a much better pilot than I am – 
			she can handle [the sharp edged thermals today]."&nbsp; Why is he 
			flying in conditions that he cannot handle?&nbsp; Why did he launch 
			in conditions that would prove challenging for him?&nbsp; See P. 228 
			of the Pilot’s Training Manual (PTM).</li>
			<li>Flying very deep in the brakes:&nbsp; He was flying a Gin glider 
			and his hands were at the Gin label which is about an inch above the 
			karabiner loop in the riser.&nbsp; PTM P. 180, “If you try to 
			maximize your climb rate by all the time flying around the edge of 
			stall while doing turns in thermals, you will eventually go too far 
			and enter a spin.”&nbsp; He wasn’t even turning in the thermal so 
			why the deep brakes?&nbsp; PTM P. 136 “In potentially turbulent 
			conditions you should fly with a small amount of brake pressure 
			(this is mandatory if at low altitudes – see the section titled 
			Getting low).”</li>
			<li>Failure to watch his wing when it was in trouble:&nbsp; The 
			pilot was looking at everything else instead of looking at his wing 
			to attempt to fix the problem.</li>
			<li>Failure to sense the impending stall:&nbsp; The video shows the 
			D risers of his right wing go slack just as he enters the thermal.&nbsp; 
			By now, it’s too late.&nbsp; He would have felt the pressure slacken 
			before they went completely slack.&nbsp; He should have immediately 
			let up on the brakes at that time.&nbsp; PTM P. 153 “If you ever 
			feel the brake pressure start to decrease then immediately back out 
			a couple of inches.&nbsp; Softening of brake pressure is an 
			indication of approaching tip stall.”</li>
			<li>Failure to dampen the surge after the stall:&nbsp; The right 
			side (at least) of the wing stalls and then restarts.&nbsp; It is 
			likely that the left is also stalled but we can’t see it to be sure.&nbsp; 
			His hands are everywhere.&nbsp; He does not dampen the surge of the 
			right wing tip and it darts forward and he enters a spiral dive to 
			the left.&nbsp; He should have entered a full stall at this point to 
			reset the wing (bury his hands and hold them until the wing 
			stabilizes over his head and do the normal things necessary to 
			safely exit the stall).&nbsp; See full stall recovery on P. 149 of 
			PTM.</li>
			<li>Did not exit the spiral dive:&nbsp; He failed to let up on the 
			inside brake, apply opposite weight shift, and apply outside brake 
			in order to exit the spiral dive.</li>
			<li>Failed to disable the glider once it started re-flying:&nbsp; 
			Pilot should have executed a B-line stall to disable the glider.&nbsp; 
			Note that the wing was fine – no cravats, no twists in the risers, 
			etc.&nbsp; PTM P. 165 “Disable the main canopy by pulling in on the 
			B or C risers.”</li>
			<li>Did not properly deploy his reserve:&nbsp; The pilot threw his 
			reserve but did not let go of the deployment bag.&nbsp; The handle 
			in the pilot’s hand and the bag are visible.&nbsp; His comment about 
			being hurt was probably the yank on his arm when he failed to let go 
			of the bag.&nbsp; He was fortunate that the reserve deployed anyway.</li>
			<li>Failed to secure himself to the tree and let go of the brakes 
			once he landed:&nbsp; Pilot should have grabbed any branch in sight 
			and pulled himself to the center of the tree in order to prevent any 
			subsequent fall.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why was the pilot still holding the 
			brakes?&nbsp; PTM P. 162&nbsp; “Let go of the brakes immediately 
			after you contact the tree and make every effort to grab the largest 
			branch you can get a hold of.”<br></li>
