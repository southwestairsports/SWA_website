	<h1>How to have trouble visiting Mexico</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>1. Visit tourist areas frequented by foreigners (Acapulco, Cancun, beach 
	areas) i.e. places that criminals know are filled with rich targets, especially unescorted women.</p>
	<p>2. Look for FUN, especially at NIGHT (drinking parties, brothels, drugs, 
	etc.)&nbsp; Actively try to "hook up" with good looking women.</p>
	<p>3. Be naïve concerning Mexican safety standards e.g., lack of lifeguards, 
	no fire safety, obvious hazards. Most people outside of Europe and North America consider Americans as small children 
	who always need a mommy.</p>
	<p>4. Ignore the ABUNDANT, UBIQUITOUS, PLAIN ENGLISH warnings from every 
	site concerning travel in Mexico: stay off the roads at NIGHT, stay only on 
	main roads!</p>
	<p>5. Be naïve concerning health care in most of the world – it is minimal.&nbsp; 
	That is why it is good to have <a href="https://www.globalrescue.com/">
	Global Rescue</a> with all the bells and whistles. Get a
	<a href="http://www.explorersatellite.com/Iridium/iridium_satellite_phones.htm">
	satellite phone</a> and a <a href="http://www.findmespot.com/en/">SPOT</a>.&nbsp; Plan ahead that you might 
	have to visit a particular hospital.&nbsp; The Mexicans have modern 
	hospitals for their own in most cities but socialism has severely deformed 
	the quality of care for the majority.&nbsp; Good care is available but it 
	will cost you.&nbsp; Be prepared to be extorted.&nbsp; Hey, this is how the 
	world works.</p>
	<p>6. Move about after dark, alone.&nbsp; Loiter around  –  move without a 
	purpose.</p>
	<p>7. Have an “attitude”.&nbsp; Be rude, selfish, condescending towards 
	others. Think “I am civilized, clean, and rich – who are these  
	backward people?”&nbsp; Stare intently at others, especially at women who 
	belong to local men.</p>
	<p>8. Refuse to learn Spanish.</p>
	<p>9. Travel alone</p>
	<p>10. Wear flashy clothes, expensive jewelry, nice watches.&nbsp; Dress to 
	stand out.&nbsp; Flash wads of cash around.&nbsp; Wear "cool" American ball 
	caps backwards on your head.&nbsp; Wear basketball shorts/RAP jeans that 
	have the crouch somewhere near your knees.&nbsp; Show off to people how cool you are.</p>
	<p>11. Drive an expensive looking car.</p>
	<p>12. Be oblivious to obvious dangers.&nbsp; E.g. be a young woman in a 
	thong and run off the main beach to secluded areas, lean on flimsy plywood 
	panels covering open elevator shafts, test the hotel balcony rail for 
	strength after having too much to drink, open your hotel door at night to 
	someone you don’t know, etc.</p>
	<p>13. Hang out in bars and drink too much.</p>
	<p>14. Do not spend the time to research exactly where you are going.&nbsp; 
	Do not carry a map or a GPS loaded with current maps.&nbsp; Follow your nose 
	around and look lost and confused, e.g. expect the taxi or bus driver to let 
	you know where to get off or where to go.&nbsp; Be ignorant and full of 
	alcohol at the same time.</p>
	<p>15. In general, forget that you are a GUEST in somebody else’s country.&nbsp; 
	The rest of the world may not share your values, especially the notion that 
	others are going to fulfill your every need, hold your hand, and watch out 
	for you.</p>
	<p>If you have experience in foreign travel and can think of other stupid 
	and dangerous things Americans do in foreign countries, I would be happy to 
	hear from you.&nbsp; <a href="../../ContactUs/contactus.htm">Contact us</a></p>
