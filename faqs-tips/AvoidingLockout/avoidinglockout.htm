	<h1>Avoiding lockout while being towed up in a paraglider</h1>
		<p>Below, a beginning pilot launches and then quickly starts into a 
		lockout.&nbsp; Look carefully and you can see the pilot's left hand 
		extended, pulling his left brake down past the karabiner and causing the 
		wing to careen to the left.&nbsp; Why did he do this?&nbsp; Typically, he started to tip to the left right after the glider came up and stuck his hand out to the left to "catch the fall."&nbsp; 
		If he had let go of the brake, it would not have been a problem but he forgot and caused the wing to dive.&nbsp; If the tow is not stopped instantly, the glider will continue its turn to the 
		left and point straight down.&nbsp; Thankfully, he learned what not to do and, a short time later, successfully launches.<br><br>Lockout is when the 
		glider dives to one side or the other with the tow line, pilot, and glider in the same plane.&nbsp; Because of gravity, the glider and pilot will travel with high speed directly towards the 
		ground.&nbsp; It is the same when a boy flies a kite, the kite begins a dive to one side, and, often as not, goes right into the ground.&nbsp; During lockout, speed and force build up very rapidly and, if the tow is not 
		stopped immediately, the pilot will hit the ground with great force and 
		can be seriously injured or worse.</p>
	<p>The tow operator is carefully trained to 
		avoid lockout which is first to recognize it is going to happen and then stopping the tow immediately.&nbsp; It is why 
		pilots should never be towed except by a USHPA certified tow technician. 
		Even when lockout is stopped, the pilot can still have an uncomfortable landing, 
		as here.&nbsp; In this case, all was well.&nbsp; The pilot picked 
		himself up and launched again, successfully.&nbsp; It is very important 
		for pilots to keep their HANDS UP at launch and only pull on the brakes 
		to steer.&nbsp; It's his job to keep the glider perpendicular to the tow 
		line at all times.</p>

	<p>In the photo below, the pilot above had a rough but, thankfully, a harmless 
	landing, doing a face-plant.&nbsp; He is lying down thinking, "What did I do?!?"&nbsp; If it happens on grass, it is a benign event.&nbsp; At mountain sites, however, it can be extremely dangerous.&nbsp; It is another important reason why we train at the 
	sod farm.&nbsp; Soft, flat grass is more forgiving than rocks, bushes, or trees.</p>

	<p>Just a few minutes later, he picked himself up and launched again without 
	problem.</p>

	<p>Below, the same pilot  –  correctly  –  is looking up at his glider and 
	adjusting it accordingly (and always GENTLY).&nbsp; Contact us for more 
	information if you need to. </p>
