	<h1>Managing a Cravat</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>PPG pilot Tom Bird launched with a cravat in his left wingtip.&nbsp; With modern paragliders, this can easily happen because of the almost invisible upper cascade lines which are about the 
	thickness of fishing line.&nbsp; Combine this with forward inflations in dead air, it is difficult to notice a cravat.&nbsp; Thankfully, it is a rare event.</p>
	<p>The size of the cravat is the critical factor.&nbsp; This one involved less than 5% of the wing's area.&nbsp; The glider is a modern PG glider, LTF B class.</p>
	<p>As a cravat increases in size, the drag increases.&nbsp; If the drag gets beyond a certain amount, the pilot is unable to prevent the glider from going into a spiral dive no matter how much 
	opposite brake is applied.&nbsp; But too much brake and the glider will stall.&nbsp; While huge cravats are rare, such an event requires immediate action.&nbsp; Can I undo it?&nbsp; If not, I must 
	immediately deploy my reserve before the glider enters an out of control dive.<br><br>Below, Tom assess the seriousness of the cravat (minimal) and now must attempt to undo it.&nbsp; It took a 
	minute or two of pulling on the stabilo (the line which runs to the tip of the wing).&nbsp; Sometimes, the pilot must pull on other lines.&nbsp; If he had been unsuccessful in getting the cravat 
	undone, it would have required him to land immediately.&nbsp; Flying with even a small cravat requires significant opposite brake which, in turn, lowers the safety margin per getting the glider 
	closer to stall.&nbsp; Having a cravat at low altitude (less than a few hundred feet) is particularly dangerous because throwing a reserve parachute is useless.</p>

	<p>Tom flying away after a successfully removing the cravat.&nbsp; It is extremely important that a pilot never panic when he realizes that he has a cravat.&nbsp; Fix it or deploy the reserve?&nbsp; 
	This is what must be decided quickly.&nbsp; Nice work, Tom!</p>
