	<h1>Ericsson field telephone M3926-384011</h1>
	<h2>Directions &amp; Operating Notes</h2>
	
	<p>Translated with notes by Had Robinson
	<a href="http://www.southwestairsports.com">www.southwestairsports.com</a></p>
	<p>The original telephone came with the following accessories: a.) Dialer 
	b.) Handset c.) Extra receiver d.) Hand tool (upper right) e.) Instructions 
	(in Swedish).&nbsp; On the surplus market all or none of these accessories 
	may be present with the set.</p>

	<p>
	<img alt="Ericsson field telephone M3926-384011" src="DSCN2421_01.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;<a href="Ericsson_Review_Vol_12_1935_2.pdf">Ericsson's 
		review</a> (1935) of this set has extensive information on its features 
	and how it should be used during wartime.</p>
	<h3>Connections</h3>
	<p>NOTE: The LB–CB selector knob 
		must be set correctly (see below) before connecting the field telephone to the 
		telephone network via terminals La and Lb.&nbsp; It does not matter which 
		terminal is used to connect to the network as the set is not polarized.</p>
	<p>The <a href="DSCN2410_01_Klyka.jpg">handset holder (Klyka)</a>, the 
	<a href="DSCN2415_01_knobs_buttons.jpg">LB–CB selector</a>, and
	<a href="DSCN2410_01_Sparr.jpg">latch bar (Spärr)</a> are 
		illustrated in these photos and also in figure 1 (Bild 1) below.</p>
	<p>1. The telephone may be connected to a central station network (e.g. ATT) 
	or directly to other field telephones.&nbsp; Connect the wires to terminals 
	La and Lb.&nbsp; These telephones will not work on digital networks.</p>
	<p>2. The <a href="DSCN2415_01_receiver_jacks.jpg">extra receiver</a> may be 
	connected to the instrument per this photo.&nbsp; There are (2) sets of 
	jacks that can be used.&nbsp; The extra receiver permits a third party to 
	monitor the telephone conversation.</p>
	<p>3.&nbsp; When used on a central station network, the
	<a href="DSCN2415_01_dialer_connection.jpg">dialer</a> may be connected to 
	the instrument per this photo.</p>

	<h3>LB – Local telephone network operation (not connected to a central station network)</h3>

	<p>1.&nbsp;The selector knob must be in the LB position.&nbsp; If it is in the CB position, do the following:</p>

	<blockquote>
		a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pull the latch bar (Spärr) straight out and hold it.<br>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Press down the selector knob and turn to position 			LB.<br>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the latch bar spring back and lock the selector latch 
		bolt (Spärrbult) in position.</blockquote>

	<p>2. The button on the handset must be depressed when speaking in order for 
	the other party to hear. It can be released when listening or held for the 
	entire call.</p>
	<p>3.&nbsp;Making a Call – Ring the other field telephone(s) on the 
		network by turning the hand crank.&nbsp; It is easy to send codes via the 
		ringer e.g. one long, two short rings so that a user can know if the call is 
		for him.</p>

	<p>4.&nbsp;Receiving a Call – Wait until the ring signal stops and THEN lift the handset to the ear 
	to avoid injury to the ear by the very loud ring signal.</p>

	<p>5.&nbsp;Ending a Call – Return the handset to the holder (though 
		this is not necessary in LB mode).</p>
		<h3>CB – Central station telephone network operation (a public telephone network e.g. ATT)</h3>

	<p>1.&nbsp;The selector knob must be in the CB position.&nbsp; If it 
		is in the LB position, do the following:</p>
	<blockquote>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pull the latch bar (Spärr) straight out and hold it.<br>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn the selector knob to position CB.&nbsp; (It will move 
		to its upper position.)<br>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the latch bar spring back and lock the selector latch 
		bolt (Spärrbult) in position.</blockquote>

	<p>2. The button on the handset must be depressed when speaking in order for 
	the other party to hear. It can be released when listening or held for the 
	entire call.</p>
	<p>3.&nbsp;Making a Call – Remove handset, press the selector knob 
		down, and check for dial tone.&nbsp; Use dialer as needed.&nbsp; Note: 
	these telephones will NOT work on digital phone systems.</p>

	<p>4.&nbsp;Receiving a Call – The ringer will sound until the handset 
		is lifted and the selector knob is pressed to its lower (locked) position.</p>

	<p>5.&nbsp;Ending a Call – Return the handset to the holder.&nbsp; 
		The selector knob will pop up to its upper position.</p>

	<p>6.&nbsp;Do NOT use the hand crank at any time when the telephone 
		is connected to a central station network.&nbsp; The central station, not 
		the telephone originating the call, supplies the ring signal to the other 
		telephone.</p>

	<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

	<p>1. Place the handset is in the holder when the telephone is not in use.&nbsp; 
		In doing this you will know that the selector knob is in the correct 
		position (up) to receive a call when in CB mode.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>2. Do not hold the handset to the ear when making any changes with the 
		selector knob as the DC impulses (clicks) are very loud.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>3. The <a href="DSCN2415_01_knobs_buttons.jpg">knob labeled “S”</a> is used for voice-frequency telegraphy in the same 
		manner as a telegraph key.&nbsp; As Ericsson notes in its review of the 
	set, the presence of a tone 
		generator allows the user to employ voice-frequency telegraphy when speech 
		is unintelligible or background noise is excessive.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>4. The set requires (2) "D" sized batteries.&nbsp; See figure 2 (Bild 2) for correct battery placement.&nbsp; A small 
		voltage is necessary for the microphone to function.&nbsp; You cannot be 
	heard by others if you do not install the batteries.&nbsp; The set is not 
		polarized so that the battery holder may be installed with the diagram 
		facing in or out.&nbsp; If it is placed facing out, it is easier to see if 
		the battery holder is installed or not.&nbsp; The use of lithium 
	batteries is recommended as they will last for many years and not leak.</p>

	<p>5. The set has a <a href="DSCN2421_01_tool.jpg">small tool</a> stowed 
	near the hand crank which can be used to disassemble the telephone (remove 
	it from the case).&nbsp; One end has a socket which, presumably, is for use 
	on ordinary Swedish phone terminals.&nbsp; I do not recommend using the tool 
	to undo the (3) screws that hold the set in its case because the screws 
	slots are much larger than the tool's blade.&nbsp; If the screws are not 
	torqued firmly, they can loosen.&nbsp; We discovered this hauling these 
	telephones through deep caves.</p>

	<p>6. During inclement weather, the set can be used in LB mode by replacing the 
		cover and dressing the cables through the small openings beneath the 
		latches.</p>
