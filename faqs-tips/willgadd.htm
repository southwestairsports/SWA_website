	<h1>Will Gadd on dangerous sports "The only path I can ride"</h1>
		<blockquote>
			Some words about extreme sports from Will Gadd. He makes a good case that it is 
not a tragedy when a guy dies while doing what he loves, an alien concept in our 
feminized culture. It is futile to tell some men not to act like men because 
they will act like real men anyway. I love paragliding  –  an extreme aviation 
sport. But I am also aware of the dangers and do whatever I can to minimize 
risk. No matter how hard I work at it, those risks will always be there each 
time I leave the earth. Like Mr. Gadd, it's the only path I can ride. I don't 
know him but he and his buddies have my deepest respect.  But then there are those who are injured.&nbsp; One of Mr. Gadd's close friends, Stewart Midwinter was badly injured when the two of them were 
			flying paragliders in Alberta, Canada.&nbsp; If you still want to fly a paraglider, you might watch this video of <a href="https://vimeo.com/54822605">Mr. Midwinter's accident and his 
			partial recovery</a> at <a href="http://www.explore-mag.com/the-grand-delusion">Mount Lady MacDonald</a>.&nbsp; It is sobering.&nbsp; If you still would like to fly, then you are like Mr. 
			Gadd and myself. –  Had</blockquote>

	Another one down...</a> </p>
	<blockquote>
	<p>Sometime in the last few weeks Johnny Copp died in an avalanche in China, 
	likely along with Micah Dash and Wade Johnson. Johnny had spent some time in 
	the basement Hilton at our house, and I'd known him for a bunch of years. 
	I'd only met Micah a few times and didn't know Wade, but I'm sorry to hear 
	that all three are permanently out of the great game of life. They added to 
	it in a hugely positive way. </p>
	<p>Every spring I involuntarily think of the springs of 2005 and 2006; 
	during those two springs seven friends died in clusters only a few months 
	apart. None of them died of old age. The older I get the less sure I am of 
	the glib responses and justifications I've always used for living a risky 
	life. I still believe that for me it's the only path I can ride, but the 
	odds become more and more obvious as I age. I recently wrote about the odds 
	of dying while climbing in Explore magazine <span class="italics">[I can't 
	find a direct link to that story on-line  –  HR]</span>. My conclusion was 
	that climbing and most mountain sports are a lot riskier than we like to 
	think they are. Sport climbing on good rock is probably the only form of 
	climbing one can expect to do for a lifetime and actually die from something 
	other than climbing in the end. And even in the controlled "sport" 
	environment almost every long-term sport climber I know has hit the ground 
	at least once, always in a "fluke" accident. As I read the on-line forums 
	about accidents and death I keep hearing the words "Fluke" and "Tragedy." 
	Both these words are nonsense when applied to accidents in mountain sports.
	</p>
	<p>For me I'm never going to use the word "tragedy" in reference to a 
	climbing or mountain sports accident again. A tragedy is when a whole family 
	gets killed by a drunk driver. A tragedy is when a little kid gets abused. A 
	tragedy is when a 30-year old mother of two young kids gets cancer and dies. 
	Dying while climbing, kayaking, paragliding, BASE jumping or any other form 
	of outdoor recreation isn't a [expletive deleted] tragedy, it's a clearly 
	predictable result of doing the activity. If I or anyone goes out while 
	doing our sports with a clear understanding of the game we're playing then 
	let's have a drink, cheer for the life lived, and move on as best we can. I 
	know it's not that simple as death leaves huge craters in life, but I think 
	that's the only sane response I can give to the continued and voluntary 
	mountain carnage I keep seeing year in and year out. To celebrate the 
	rewards without clearly understanding the risks is not only bad math but 
	blatant self-deception. </p>
	<p>So here's to all my friends who went out with their boots on. And to my 
	two friends currently in the hospital, you're [expletive deleted] lucky, and 
	I'm glad you were.</p>
