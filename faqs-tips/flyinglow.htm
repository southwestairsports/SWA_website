	<h1>Why flying low to the ground gives us a false sense of security</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson </p>
	<p>It is normal for pilots to feel more "safe" when flying less than 500' 
	above the ground. The ground looks welcoming and is a familiar site. On the 
	other hand, being a mile or more off the ground is a perspective that we 
	rarely experience. It can take a half an hour or much more to come down from 
	high altitude. Also, what is going on way up there? Can I get blown away or 
	sucked into outer space? Will I get hit by some careless aircraft? Will I 
	run out of air to breathe? </p>
	<p>These are all false notions that routinely get pilots killed or injured. 
	Here is why: </p>
	<p>1. <strong>Rowdy Air</strong> -- The air near the ground is always more turbulent and fickle and, 
	therefore, more dangerous. The only time I ever experienced an injury while 
	paragliding was getting dumped out of the air while ridge soaring 10' away 
	from the side of the mountain. The only exception to this is air near large 
	bodies of water and air in an inversion. Nonetheless, pilots who fly in 
	inversions need to master their weather skills because the inversion can 
	dissipate in minutes and you may be flying in air that is moving faster than 
	your forward speed, i.e., you are now flying backwards. Even in inversions, 
	the air near the ground can still be rowdy, though rarely. If you must fly 
	PPG low, do it early in the day and always maintain enough altitude 
	(typically &gt;100' AGL) so that you can land in any direction. </p>
	<p>2. <strong>Altitude Gives Time</strong> -- Altitude always gives you more time to fix problems. For example, I 
	was once flying a paramotor for a demo and my engine quit suddenly. I was 
	thankful that I was 500' off the ground as I had time to make plans on where 
	to land. In fact, I had enough time to attempt to figure out why the engine 
	quit. The spark plug wire had come loose and I was able to reattach it and 
	restart the engine. If I was 100' off the ground, I could never have done 
	this. The same is true for PG. While flying Dry Canyon during an active time 
	of the day, I had a major wing collapse (a complete frontal) and I was 
	thankful I had a thousand feet to sort it out and recover. As it was, I lost 
	200' of altitude in a few seconds. At another time, at a benign site in early 
	morning, a convergence of some sort caused the air 50' off the ground to 
	suddenly nose dive to the ground while I was climbing out in a 
	paramotor. I experienced not one but two frontal collapses in a row. The 
	worst thing I could have done would have been to let off the power, as is 
	the normal recommendation when experiencing turbulence. As it was, I went to 
	full power and was able to quickly re-inflate the glider. I have never 
	experienced this strange event before or since. This is just another reason 
	to climb out quickly after launching. Altitude is ALWAYS good! </p>
	<p>3. <strong>Organized Air Higher Up</strong> -- Thermals and ridge lift are always more organized the higher you go. 
	Dust devils are deadly near the ground, especially if they travel over areas 
	of green vegetation where they can become invisible. Once during a flight in 
	the late afternoon, an invisible dust devil formed and I flew right into it 
	with a paramotor. I was about 100' off the ground climbing out and was 
	severely jolted by the force of the devil on one side of my glider. This is 
	how we break lines, especially in PPG. To escape it, I dove away from it, 
	taking great risk so close to the earth. In this case, I was very near water 
	and, if I had gone in, I would have likely drowned. The dust devil should 
	not have been there at that time of the day. Apparently, a mass of hot air 
	was lurking in tall dry weeds and something allowed it to be released just 
	as I flew over. (Maybe I was the one who disturbed the air?) Cascading 
	events often get us pilots and this event could have resulted in an 
	accident. Had I been much higher, the event would have been a non-issue. 
	This is just another reason why pilots should always climb out as quickly as 
	they can, whether PG or PPG. If you practice PPG "touch and goes", make sure 
	you are close enough to the ground that sudden contact with it would not 
	result in trouble. Altitude is ALWAYS good! </p>
	<p>4. <strong>Check the Forecasts</strong> -- The chances of a pilot getting sucked up 30,000' are nil if he does 
	his homework before flying. The weather balloons sent up by the National 
	Weather Service have nothing to do with being a forecast of some sort. The 
	balloons capture raw data and accurately report what the winds and 
	temperature are to the edges of the atmosphere. Pilots who do not check this 
	kind of data before flying are  –  in a word  –  stupid. If the atmosphere is 
	unstable or crazy aloft, fly another day. If winds aloft above the inversion 
	are over 25 mph, make certain you land way before the inversion dissipates 
	or, better, don't fly at all  –  maybe you miscalculated when the inversion 
	would be gone? I have flown backwards and it can be unnerving going where 
	you do not want to go. Don't fly without doing your homework beforehand. If 
	you see towering cumulus clouds forming, land immediately  –  it's a simple 
	technique for not having an adventure inside a rain cloud. </p>
	<p>5. <strong>Altitude gives time</strong> -- The higher you are the more time you have to plan where you might land 
	in an emergency. Flying low over congested areas is not only illegal, it is 
	dangerous. Pilots who assume they will not have to land for some reason need 
	to get re-educated. Launching is optional, landing is mandatory and can 
	happen at anytime. TRAIN YOURSELF ACCORDINGLY  –  NEVER FLY ANYWHERE WITHOUT 
	HAVING THIS ALWAYS IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND: WHERE CAN I LAND RIGHT NOW??? 
	Failure to plan can lead to panic. It has killed or injured a significant 
	number of pilots needlessly. Altitude is always good! </p>
	<p>6. <strong>Panic</strong> -- If you do panic while flying, altitude can give you time to get 
	yourself together. Be ready for unexpected events. Do not think, "That can 
	never happen to me!" Altitude is always good! </p>
	<p>7. <strong>Air collision</strong> -- I do not think a PG or PPG pilot has ever been hit by another 
	aircraft. This is not to say that the reverse has not occurred, especially 
	concerning hot air balloons. </p>
	<p>8. <strong>Altitude is always good</strong> -- Repeat this phrase to yourself often.</p>
