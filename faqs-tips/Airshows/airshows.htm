	<h1>Air show performances</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>Flying and doing modest acrobatics and stunts before crowds in a powered paraglider (PPG) is a huge amount of fun.&nbsp; We are popular with crowds because, in contrast with all other aircraft, 
	they are easy to track, colorful, graceful, and relatively quiet.&nbsp; Powered paragliders operate at a fraction of the cost of all other powered aircraft so pilots do not have to be particularly 
	well-to-do.&nbsp; Air show sponsors like them because <span class="italics">they are different.</span>&nbsp; The small and powerful airplanes that perform many of the acrobatics and stunts we see 
	are commonplace.&nbsp; If you fly one of these and want to be invited to fly in an air show, you better be one of the best in the country.&nbsp; Another bonus is that PPG pilots attend the same 
	safety briefings and occupy the same hangars as the top guns, such as the Blue Angels.&nbsp; A pilot at an air show is a pilot, however lowly (the PPG).</p>
	<p>A downside of flying in an air show is that you cannot be paid any compensation for it (in the United States) because it is strictly against FAA rules.&nbsp; Unlike other aircraft, we are 
	extremely sensitive to weather conditions e.g. if winds are above 12 mph, we most likely will have to cancel.&nbsp; Because PPG cannot tolerate strong turbulence, we have to ask (beg) that the 
	operators will put us first on the program so that we can be out of the air by mid-morning.</p>
	<p>Minimum Requirements</p>
	<p>1. EXPERIENCE -- You must be an experienced pilot.&nbsp; If you have less than 250 hours of flying time, you probably should not be doing this.&nbsp; This is because all basic flight operations 
	of a PPG pilot must be automatic.&nbsp; There is no time to think about throttle and brake operations when flying in front of the public.&nbsp; You will have enough on your mind per doing team 
	stunts, staying within the flight lines, and getting in and out of the show area at the right times.&nbsp; Air show pilots should have a PPG3 rating from the USPPA.</p>
	<p>2. PRACTICE -- You cannot participate in an air show unless you have an act.&nbsp; Deploying smoke is the easiest and safest.&nbsp; This site has some suggestions on how to deploy smoke 
	grenades.&nbsp; Most grenades last about 90 seconds but experienced pilots can deploy enough grenades to last the length of the show, usually about 5 minutes.&nbsp; Flying a streamer requires 
	weeks of practice but is one of the unique things only a PPG can do.&nbsp; Pilots must master both deployment and landing the streamer.&nbsp; Here are some <a href="../Streamers/streamer.htm">
	further instructions and tips</a> on streamers for PPG.</p>
	<p>3. INSURANCE -- No air show operator will permit any aircraft to fly unless it has 3rd party liability insurance.&nbsp; For a reasonable amount, pilots may apply for insurance through a program 
	administered by the United States Ultralight Association (USUA).&nbsp; Pilots will have to join the USUA.</p>
	<p>4. GROUND CREW -- Like the other aircraft, we still need a ground crew to help us setup, maintain communications with the control tower, and do all possible tasks so that the pilot can intently 
	focus on his flying routine.&nbsp; The meetings of all pilots are extremely important.&nbsp; It is here that the air show operators and sometimes FAA representatives will discuss the rules and 
	expectations of the show in order to guard the safety of the public -- our #1 priority.</p>
