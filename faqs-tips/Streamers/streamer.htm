	<h1>Streamer Preparation &amp; Deployment</h1>
		<p>by Had Robinson with assistance from Glenn Tupper and Lee Boone</p>
	<p>Southwest Airsports can supply specially made streamers for towing by a 
	paramotor.&nbsp; Please
	<a href="../../ContactUs/contactus.htm">contact us</a> for more info.</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Our team has developed a safe and practical way for experienced paramotor 
	pilots to deploy and tow streamers that can exceed 1,000' in length.&nbsp; 
	Ordinary fixed wing aircraft have a complicated way to pick a streamer or 
	banner up from the ground using poles and hooks.&nbsp; Slow moving 
	paramotors, on the other hand, may deploy in the air and are not overly 
	burdened by streamer drag.</p>
	<p>CAUTION:&nbsp; ONLY EXPERIENCED PPG PILOTS SHOULD ATTEMPT TO DEPLOY 
	AND/OR TOW ANY OBJECT, INCLUDING A STREAMER.&nbsp; THERE IS SIGNIFICANT RISK 
	OF ENTANGLEMENT WITH THE PARAMOTOR AND/OR OTHER OBJECTS INCLUDING OTHER 
	AIRCRAFT.&nbsp; ENTANGLEMENT WITH THE PARAMOTOR COULD RESULT IN THE PILOT 
	BEING DRAWN INTO THE SPINNING PROPELLER!&nbsp; AN ACCIDENT COULD RESULT IN 
	INJURY OR DEATH.&nbsp; THE INFORMATION GIVEN HERE IS ONLY INTENDED TO HELP 
	 –  IT IS NOT A THOROUGH DISCUSSION OF THE SKILLS NEEDED TO TRANSPORT, 
	DEPLOY, AND TOW A STREAMER.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>A master PPG pilot and instructor asked me about picking up streamers 
	from the ground.&nbsp; My answer: We quit doing it.&nbsp; When it works, it 
	works great. However, we had problems – even with experienced pilots. One 
	missed the pickup device and had a frustrating time trying to pick it up 
	again and wasted precious time allotted to us during an air show.&nbsp; 
	Another came in to pick up a streamer, got a bit too low, caught his foot, 
	and did a nice face plant – tearing up his prop and slicing a few lines on 
	his glider.&nbsp; After such incidents, we decided there must be a better, 
	safer way that works 100% of the time. For air shows, this is a “must” for 
	us. At casual events, who cares if you miss it?&nbsp; At contests, someone 
	drills in and props/lines get whacked – it’s part of the deal. But at public 
	events like what we do, it looks bad. I would submit that crashing into the 
	ground is always bad no matter where the venue....</p>

	<p>The streamers deployed in the photos here are approximately (700)' long x (1)' wide.</p>
	<h2>General practices</h2>
	<p>
Towing a streamer is about comfortably dealing with 
	increased drag and having a tail 700'+ long.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>&nbsp;Always trim your 
	glider to go as slow as possible because the drag (about 4 lbs.) increases 
	dramatically as your speed through the air increases.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Do not 
	deploy or tow the streamer at low altitudes (below 200') unless you are 
	certain that it will not contact water or anything which could snag it.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;You must be comfortable flying with one hand or, better, no hands for brief 
	periods which means you will not want to fly during thermic conditions.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Pilots must be extremely careful around other aircraft.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Do NOT 
	deploy except when the paramotor is at idle speed and there is nothing 
	around, especially other aircraft.&nbsp; This will reduce the risk of the 
	streamer being sucked into a propeller (and maybe along with the pilot's 
	hand/arm) or colliding with another pilot.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Before launching, chose 
	a suitable location where you can drop the streamer safely.&nbsp; You do not 
	want to drop it on another aircraft below (the pilot cannot see it coming)!</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Practice deployment on the ground before doing it in the air.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;If you over-seal the d-bag with masking tape, it requires more time to open 
	the bag when you are ready to deploy.&nbsp; A d-bag that is not completely 
	open can cause the lines and/or streamer to become tangled.&nbsp; If you do 
	it correctly, (3) pieces of tape is sufficient to prevent the streamer from 
	"leaking" out of the bag.&nbsp; A carelessly or poorly sealed d-bag can 
	suddenly "leak" the streamer which will  –  without exception  –  find its way 
	back into the paramotor.&nbsp; Of course, the risk of this is greatly 
	reduced if the engine is at idle.&nbsp; A streamer that becomes entangled in 
	the lines of another glider (including your own) could cause unpredictable 
	handling.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHILE TOWING and always have an 
	"out" where you can fly away into clear air space.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Do not tow 
	with another pilot unless you have practiced flying in formation together 
	without streamers.&nbsp; Piloting your paramotor must be second-nature as 
	you will be occupied with the streamer and have little concentration left to 
	think about flying, especially directional control.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Landing with 
	the streamer attached is not a problem for a skilled pilot and is probably 
	safer than flying around at low altitudes with one hand and attempting to 
	get the bridal off your foot.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Before ditching the streamer a 
	pilot must consider wind direction and speed.&nbsp; The streamer will drift 
	with the wind and can land in such fun things as power lines and trees.&nbsp; 
	If this happens, you will likely have to abandon your streamer.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Practicing before the public or friends is not the best venue to learn this 
	skill.&nbsp; Towing a streamer requires intense concentration.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>
	How to deploy a streamer </h2>
	<h3>A.&nbsp; Preparing the streamer</h3>
	<p>You will need kitchen size 
	garbage bags, a 2' bungee cord, some 1" masking tape, weak link cord rated 
	at 15 lb. or so, a bridal (a speed bar works well), used glider lines (12' - 
	15').&nbsp; You may double the glider lines so that it has a total length of 
	20-30'.&nbsp; The farther the streamer is behind your paramotor, the less 
	prop wash and drag there is.</p>
	<p>Attach the streamer, the glider lines, weak leak, and bridal in the order 
	shown.&nbsp; You can add fishing "swivel" (not shown) to help reduce 
	twisting of the weak link and tow line.&nbsp; The weak link is the most 
	critical part of the set up.&nbsp; You do NOT want the streamer attached to 
	you if it catches something!</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="streamers for powered paragliders" src="IMG_1082.JPG" width="512" height="384"></p>
	<h3>B. Packing the d-bag</h3>
	<p>Put a kitchen trash bag in a suitable container 
	and start stuffing the streamer  –  end first  –  into the bag.&nbsp; The 
	technique here is similar to how climbers stuff a rope into a rope bag.&nbsp; 
	You must not attempt to fold, wrap, roll, etc. the streamer in any way.&nbsp; 
	Just stuff it into the bag in 4-10' segments.&nbsp; It is slippery nylon and 
	will deploy smoothly.&nbsp; Leave the lines outside the bag for now.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="streamers for powered paragliders" src="IMG_1079.JPG" width="512" height="384"></p>
	<p>Remove the d-bag and carefully lay the line on the top of the packed 
	streamer.&nbsp; If you have a long line (over 15'), it can be prepared like 
	the lines of a parachute (see next photo down).&nbsp; However, experience 
	has demonstrated that laying any length of line inside the bag in the same 
	way as packing the glider allows the line to deploy nicely.&nbsp; If the 
	lines are prepared like the lines of a parachute there might be a slightly 
	less chance of friction knots forming or the line becoming entangled with 
	the streamer when it is deployed.&nbsp; However, doing the lines in the 
	fashion of a parachute re-pack is a lot of extra work.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="streamers for powered paragliders" src="IMG_1083.JPG" width="512" height="384"></p>
	<p>Optional  –  A longer bridal line rubber-banded and attached to the 
	exterior of the d-bag.&nbsp; We have tried wrapping the lines with masking 
	tape instead of rubber bands and it seems to work OK.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="streamers for powered paragliders" src="IMG_1088.JPG" width="512" height="384"></p>
	<p>There are (3) - (5) pieces of tape sealing the d-bag.&nbsp; Be careful as 
	you do not want the d-bag to "leak" streamer.&nbsp; If a little piece is 
	exposed while flying, the streamer will quickly start coming out and find 
	its way into the paramotor. &nbsp;Heavy bags can be tightly wrapped with tape but 
	the more the streamer is compressed the greater the risk of it "exploding" 
	when the bag is unsealed and then getting tangled in equipment or the prop 
	(even if it is not turning).&nbsp; Experiment on the ground with what works 
	best for you but keep these warnings in mind.&nbsp; We have had streamers 
	wind up in props which were at full power a few times.</p>
	<p>Keep the tape to a 
	minimum as you will have to tear it open just before you deploy.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="streamers for powered paragliders" src="IMG_1084.JPG" width="512" height="384"></p>
	<p>The d-bag is ready.&nbsp; Note the 2' bungee cord used to attach the 
	d-bag to the frame of the paramotor.&nbsp; We generally remove the bungee 
	when 100'+ over the ground and flying safely in a straight direction.&nbsp; 
	Removing and stowing the bungee is one of the more difficult things.&nbsp; 
	We have tried slipping the bungee down and off the bag and it seems to work 
	well.&nbsp; The bungee remains attached and you don't have to waste time 
	trying to stow it.&nbsp; Do what works best, even throwing the bungee cord 
	away.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="streamers for powered paragliders" src="IMG_1086.JPG" width="512" height="384"></p>
	<h3>C.&nbsp; Attaching the d-bag to the pilot</h3>
	<p>The pilot, Lee Boone, is 
	ready to go.&nbsp; I recommend that pilots attach themselves to the glider, 
	do their pre-flight check, and THEN attach the d-bag.&nbsp; The presence of 
	the d-bag hinders a clear view of the pilot's critical flying areas such as 
	the speed system and riser attachments.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="streamers for powered paragliders" src="DSC6437.jpg" width="257" height="356"></p>
	<p>photo courtesy of John Shaw</p>
	<p>Below, Had Robinson launches.&nbsp; The d-bag rests nicely on his closed 
	flight deck.&nbsp; The d-bag must have some sort of lower support or it will 
	slip out when doing a vigorous forward inflation.&nbsp; (We discovered this 
	from experience.)</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="streamers for powered paragliders" src="DSC6453.jpg" width="406" height="505"></p>
	<p>photo courtesy of John Shaw</p>
	<p>DANGER:&nbsp; Carrying the d-bag anywhere but in front where it can be 
	carefully watched is risky. Accidental deployment during the first 60 
	seconds of flight could result in an accident so pilots must be exceedingly 
	careful.&nbsp; That is, if the streamer starts to deploy and snags with 
	something on the pilot and then with something on the ground, the pilot 
	could be yanked backwards with the glider plunging forward before he knows 
	what has happened.</p>
	<h3>D. Pre-deployment</h3>
	<p>Removing the bungee cord prior to deployment is 
	awkward and difficult.&nbsp; You may shove the bungee cord down and over the 
	d-bag.&nbsp; The cord remains attached to the pilot and paramotor but is 
	effectively out of the way.&nbsp; With this method, the pilot does not have 
	to stow the cord someplace.&nbsp; The on-rushing air will keep the d-bag 
	nicely pressed against the pilot's chest once the cord is removed.&nbsp; The 
	cord is only needed at launch.&nbsp; Be sure you have plenty of altitude 
	when preparing for deployment.&nbsp; You MUST be at idle!&nbsp; Pilots have 
	had their hands pulled into props by entangled brake lines.&nbsp; It happens 
	so quickly that you do not have enough time to think "Let go!"</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="streamers for powered paragliders" src="Deploy01.jpg" width="640" height="360"></p>
	<p>Here, the bungee cord is removed so it can be stowed or dropped.&nbsp; At 
	this point, you can resume full power and fly about safely.&nbsp; Prior to 
	deployment, you do NOT want to be at full power when any part of your body 
	is connected to the streamer.</p>
	<p>
<img alt="streamers for powered paragliders" src="Deploy02.jpg" width="640" height="360"></p>
	<h3>E. D-bag deployment</h3>
	<p>When you are ready to deploy, get away from 
	everyone and everything, make sure that you are flying straight and will not 
	collide with anything for a minute or so.&nbsp; Go to idle or turn your 
	engine off.&nbsp; Things will go more smoothly if you first break/tear all 
	of the masking tape.&nbsp; Having the bad open allows the line and streamer 
	to come out more easily and in just the same way it was packed.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Grab the d-bag bridle firmly.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="streamers for powered paragliders" src="deploy00.jpg" width="640" height="360"></p>
	<p>If necessary, use both hands to firmly and quickly shove the bag down 
	between your legs.&nbsp; If it goes to the side, it could get snagged on the 
	paramotor frame.&nbsp; Remember to be at idle when actually deploying.&nbsp; 
	It is so tempting to climb out while deploying but you place yourself at 
	significant risk if anything goes wrong.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="streamers for powered paragliders" src="Deploy04B.jpg" width="640" height="360"></p>
	<p>
	<img alt="streamers for powered paragliders" src="Deploy05.jpg" width="640" height="360"></p>
	<p>If you did not open the bag properly, you may have to yank up smartly on 
	the bridle to get it free.&nbsp; If the bridle line gets tangled in the 
	streamer, LET GO OF EVERYTHING IMMEDIATELY!&nbsp; Go and land, retrieve the 
	d-bag, and try it again.&nbsp; Don't fiddle around in the air  –  you are not 
	concentrating on flying and risk hitting other pilots, getting too low, etc.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="streamers for powered paragliders" src="Deploy06.jpg" width="640" height="360"></p>
	<p>Quickly put the bridle on your foot.&nbsp; Someone may ask, "Why not 
	attach it with a karabiner to the engine frame or harness?"&nbsp; With the 
	bridle on your foot, you are always aware of the streamer's drag and can 
	sense any change quickly.&nbsp; You can also discover how to ascend with the 
	streamer while minimizing drag and so increase your climb out rate.&nbsp; If 
	you snag something on the ground, you will have plenty of time to drop your 
	bridle and not tear the streamer and/or break your weak link.&nbsp; 
	Ascending/descending efficiently is done by flying in a tight circle  –  a 
	skilled technique used to lower the streamer to a single spot on the ground 
	or in the water and then raise it up again.&nbsp; This is a fun stunt to 
	perform before an audience.</p>
	<p>The d-bag dropping to earth with 700' of streamer pouring out is also a 
	beautiful and unique sight.&nbsp; It is a one of kind thing that only we can 
	do.</p>

	<img alt="streamers for powered paragliders" src="Deploy08.jpg" width="640" height="360"></p>
	<p>Here is a YouTube <a href="https://youtu.be/R1fVVAP7jBM">video of various deployments</a> by the author.&nbsp; 
	Carefully watch the streamer as it deploys  –  dropping hundreds of feet 
	towards the ground.&nbsp; Please
	<a href="../../ContactUs/contactus.htm">contact me</a> if you need help or have questions or comments.&nbsp; My 
	desire is that no one gets hurt flying streamers and that we share this 
	beautiful sight with the public.</p>
	<h3>F.&nbsp; After the tow</h3>
	<p>Generally, a pilot must learn how the streamer 
	behaves when in huge coils in the air.&nbsp; If the air is calm, climb to a 
	few hundred feet and begin tight circling.&nbsp; The streamer will drop 
	right down to the ground.&nbsp; At 100' remove the bridal from your foot and 
	drop it.&nbsp; Practice getting the bridal off your foot without using your 
	hand so you do not have to let go of the toggles  –  which is always 
	dangerous when near the ground.</p>
	<p>Practice makes perfect with this, especially if there is any surface 
	wind.&nbsp; It takes about (15) seconds for a streamer to drop 100' so if 
	the surface wind is (5) mph, for example, the streamer will drift about 175' 
	before coming down to the ground.&nbsp; Therefore, you will want to fly 
	upwind for this distance before making your coils.&nbsp; As the coil drops, 
	it drifts so continue to make the coils upwind.&nbsp; When you are ready to 
	drop the bridal, fly to just upwind of the coils on the ground and drop it.&nbsp; 
	It will look something like this photo below.&nbsp; Doing it this way saves 
	a lot of time re-packing the streamer.&nbsp; It is easy for the streamer to 
	get snagged the moment it touches the ground but it does not matter  –  if 
	you continue flying in a circle.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="streamers for powered paragliders" src="StreamerOnGnd.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>If you let the streamer drop onto a tarmac (below), the slightest breeze 
	will blow it around and it tends to roll itself into a long wad.&nbsp; If 
	you pack it when it is rolled up, it tends to deploy rolled up and is harder 
	to see.&nbsp; It will unroll in the air but takes a while.</p>
	<p>Be smart  –  be safe.&nbsp;Had</p>
