	<h1>Powered paragliding (PPG) equipment - typical setup</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>We at Southwest Airsports 
	provide valuable and custom information to student pilots concerning what 
	equipment is best for them.&nbsp; They can only get this information at a 
	school like ours.&nbsp; The Internet can be helpful but no one coming to us 
	for training has the experience and skill necessary to make the best 
	decisions concerning such things as gliders, helmets, and harnesses.&nbsp; Mistakes here can result in accidents and injuries or, at the least, be a waste of money.&nbsp; Nor is it particularly 
	ethical to ask us for information on what is the best wing, for example, and then go buy it elsewhere.</p>
	<p>
	Registered flight schools in the U.S. will not sell gliders except to their 
	own students.&nbsp; We do not consider it a good safety measure to show up 
	for training with equipment purchased elsewhere.&nbsp; Student pilots often 
	buy used equipment and later discover defects or problems which interfere 
	with their learning to fly safely.&nbsp; For example, a student will buy a 
	glider rated for "intermediate" pilots and then discovers that he is unable 
	to handle it at his level of skill.&nbsp; He is not happy and we must waste 
	our time doing a repeat training on our school gliders.&nbsp; Your purchase 
	of gear from us helps us offset the real cost of providing you the best 
	training available.&nbsp; We sell everything a pilot needs to fly a 
	paraglider safely.</p>
	<p>You should invest 
	in top quality equipment not just because it works better and lasts longer 
	but because it is increases your margin of safety.</p>
	<p>
	A complete PPG setup costs $7,500-$12,000 (2014) depending 
	on the paramotor type, foot-launched or trike/quad, and how many accessories 
	desired.&nbsp; Most PPG pilots do not have a vario, GPS unit, reserve, and 
	other flight accessories which helps reduce the cost.</p>
	<h2>The wing</h2>
	<p>
Gliders are rated for their ability to recover from collapses 
	while flying.&nbsp; Gliders that have an
	<a href="../PGRating.pdf">LTF</a> "A" rating generally recover spontaneously from collapses.&nbsp; 
	Gliders with higher LTF letter ratings require more pilot input to recover.&nbsp; 
	Collapses often happen when flying in air that has turbulence caused by 
	thermals.&nbsp; Flying early or late in the day 
	minimizes turbulence.&nbsp; Why do pilots choose wings that require more input to fix 
	problems?&nbsp; It is because these wings have generally higher 
	performance.&nbsp; 
	$2,500 - $4,300.&nbsp; Cost is based on performance and quality.</p>
	<p>
	We are an <a href="http://www.flyozone.com/paramotor/en/">Ozone</a> dealer.&nbsp; You can go to their site for extensive information on the gliders they offer.&nbsp; Contact us for prices and 
	availability.</p>
	<p>

	<p>What class or wing should I fly?&nbsp; It depends on where you fly most 
	of the time.&nbsp; Pilots who only fly on the coasts will rarely experience 
	turbulent air.&nbsp; On the other hand, pilots who fly in the mountainous 
	desert, like the southwest U.S., can experience&nbsp; the most turbulent air 
	in the world.&nbsp; Training is the most critical for the latter type of 
	pilot, especially having the skills to "read" flying conditions.&nbsp; As a 
	result, we recommend that newer pilots who fly in our region fly only LTF A 
	or DHV 1 gliders.&nbsp; Events can happen so quickly that most average 
	pilots will not have time to respond quickly enough.&nbsp; The lower 
	performing gliders have a much better chance of spontaneous recovery from 
	collapses with minimal pilot input.&nbsp; Our experience has shown that 
	pilots who fly more advanced gliders wish they had not flown them here in 
	the southwest.&nbsp; When our pilots go to the coasts or the eastern (and 
	humid) U.S., they find the air relatively benign in comparison  –  and easy 
	to fly in.</p>
	<h2>The paramotor</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;The paramotor below is the Miniplane <a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/pages/models.htm">Top 80</a>.&nbsp; 
	These paramotors are good for pilots whose base weight is less 200 lbs.&nbsp; These are 
	the lightest and most agile paramotors available in the world and are our 
	top seller.&nbsp; Bigger pilots can purchase the
	Miniplane <a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/pages/models.htm">Polini</a> or <a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/pages/minari.htm">Minari</a>.&nbsp; 
	The Polini Thor 130 engine weighs almost the same as the Minari 180.&nbsp; The latter has a 40% larger engine but is not as quiet as the former.</p>
	<p>I like the Miniplane low hang-point models (ABM) because I am primarily a PG (free flying) pilot and, more importantly, we train pilots on the standard PG harnesses which have low hang-points.&nbsp; 
	Low hang-points give pilots more input from the glider than high hang-points which is why PG pilots always prefer low hang-points.&nbsp; After pilots learn to fly a paraglider without a motor on a 
	low hang-point harness, it is much easier for them to transition to a paramotor with low hang-points because the handling and feeling will be similar.&nbsp; The downside of the low hang-point 
	paramotor is that there is more motion of the entire paramotor which, for some, can be objectionable.</p>
	<p>Go to <a href="http://www.miniplane-usa.com/pages/models.htm">Miniplane-USA </a>for the description and prices of the Miniplane paramotors.&nbsp; Orders for paramotors are placed with Southwest 
	Airsports.</p>
	<h2>Trike paramotor</h2>
	<p>Below is a typical trike with the Fresh 
	Breeze Simonini 122 paramotor called the
	<a href="http://www.trikebuggy.com/classic/index.htm">TrikeBuggy</a>.&nbsp; 
	Most paramotors can be worn on the back for foot-launched PPG or mounted, as 
	here, on a trike or quad.&nbsp; This PPG setup has a reserve parachute 
	mounted.&nbsp; Most PPG pilots do not have reserves as they only fly in calm 
	conditions.&nbsp; The trike is able to travel great speeds when on the 
	ground and is more stable than quads.&nbsp; The frame is also very tough  –  
	a heavy pilot can land hard with these frames and not damage them.&nbsp; Our 
	repeated testing has proven this.&nbsp; The tougher the frame, the less 
	chance of injury.&nbsp; Pilots who cannot run or having any impairment in 
	the feet, legs, or back are good candidates for a trike.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="TrikeBuggy ultralight" src="TrikeBuggy.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<h2>The 
	helmet</h2>
	<p>
PPG helmets must have communications equipment built in that 
	allows the pilot to easily communicate with others in a high noise 
	environment.&nbsp; The helmet below (the
	<a href="http://www.icaro2000.com/Products/Helmets/Scarab/Scarab.htm">ICARO 
	Scarab</a>) costs around $390.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="ICARO Scarab paramotor helmet" src="IcaroScarab.jpg" width="490" height="478"></p>
	<h2>The radio</h2>
	<p>The radio is far more 
	than a convenience when flying.&nbsp; It is your connection with other 
	pilots and the ground for weather information, pilots in distress, and other 
	emergencies.&nbsp; It must be simple and easy to operate.&nbsp; Most PPG 
	pilots use simple family band radios but that is now changing with the new 
	Chinese Bao Feng 2 meter radios which are ready to go.&nbsp; Pilots, however, 
	must have an Amateur Radio License from the FCC to legally use them on the amateur bands.&nbsp; For this reason, I recommend that all pilots get an amateur radio license.&nbsp; It's easier than 
	ever.&nbsp; Most bigger cities have radio clubs and the people who can quickly train you and administer the test.</p>
	<p>However, if you use only the USHPA radio frequencies, you do not need a license because the station license is held by USHPA.&nbsp; For the details of these frequencies go to our
	<a href="../radio.htm">radio setup page</a>, 2nd paragraph down.</p>
	<p>All radios must be used with a helmet designed for high noise 
	environments as it is impossible to hear the radio without ear protection 
	and a special noise canceling microphone.</p>
	<p>
Below is a photo of the Motorola MR350R radio available at stores like 
	Academy Sports.&nbsp; Cost: $ 75/pair.&nbsp; However, if you fly more than a 
	few miles from other pilots, you will want a 2 meter radio that can use the USHPA frequencies.&nbsp;
	<a href="../../ContactUs/contactus.htm">Contact us</a> for more information on these radios.&nbsp; We sell the 
	modified versions.</p>
	<p>

	<h2>The GPS</h2>
	<p>How fast am I moving over the ground?&nbsp; 
	What is the wind direction on the ground? How high am I?&nbsp; Where did I 
	go today?&nbsp; What does my track look like on Google Earth?&nbsp; All of 
	these questions can be answered with a GPS.&nbsp; While it is optional for 
	PPG, we highly recommend its use.&nbsp; With a GPS we can tell whether we 
	are starting to slow down and in what direction we are going.&nbsp; If we 
	ever get in trouble with authorities per "you were flying over X" but we 
	were not, the GPS log can prove our innocence (but only if our GPS can log 
	our tracks and we have set it up properly).&nbsp; If we have plenty of 
	money, we can buy a variometer that also has a GPS but those of us who 
	really know and use these devices generally prefer a separate unit which can 
	double for hiking and driving as well.&nbsp; The most common, rugged, and 
	easy to use GPS is the GARMIN top-of-the-line models for hiking, like the
	<a href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?cID=145&amp;pID=63801">Garmin 
	62s</a>.&nbsp; The older Garmin 60csx pictured below is also excellent and 
	can be had for a good price on the used market and is still available new 
	from suppliers like Amazon.&nbsp; Cost: $150 - $400</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Garmin 60CSX GPS" src="Garmin60csx.jpg" width="300" height="300"></p>
	<h2>The variometer</h2>
	<p>
If you want to thermal in your paramotor, you must have one of 
	these, preferably one that also has a recorder.&nbsp; The variometer (or 
	"vario") measures your vertical speed through the air instantaneously.&nbsp; 
	It gives an easy visual indication as well as a varying tone, if the pilots 
	wants.&nbsp; It can even give an audio tone indicating when the pilot is in 
	sink.&nbsp; The vario also can tell you your relative altitude, your actual 
	altitude, air temperature, and (optional) airspeed.&nbsp; A GPS can give 
	vertical speed but there is too much of a delay in the display of the 
	information to be useful for thermalling.&nbsp; A recording variometer 
	records all of the above for your whole flight.&nbsp; You can download it to 
	your computer and analyze your flight carefully.&nbsp; How well did I 
	thermal today?&nbsp; Here is a photo of the Flytec 6010.&nbsp; Cost is 
	around $700.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="FLYTEC 6010 variometer" src="Vario.jpg" width="168" height="300"></p>
	<h2>Other equipment</h2>
	<p>
Things like a flight suit, gloves, catheters, etc. can be useful, 
	depending on conditions and where/when you are flying.&nbsp; Most PPG pilots 
	do not carry a reserve but go here if you would like more info on 
	<a href="../pgsetup/pgsetup.htm#The_Reserve">rescue systems</a>.</p>
	<h2>Gear size and weight</h2>
	<p>
Some foot launched PPG equipment can fit in two suitcases.&nbsp; Many 
	wheeled PPG setups can easily fit in a pickup truck bed or in the trunk of a 
	small car.</p>
	<p>A Top 80 foot launched paramotor weights under 50 lbs. with fuel.&nbsp; Trikes 
	and quads can weight up 125 lbs.</p>
