	<h1>Radio Setup Info for Pilots</h1>
	<p>By Had Robinson</p>
	<p>For the YAESU FT-60R, VX-150/170 (discontinued), FT-250R/270R (discontinued), various other YAESU models, and other 
		brands of 2m amateur radio transceivers.</p>
	<p>USHPA Radio Frequencies 151.505, 151.625, 151.925, 151.955, and 158.400 
	MHz, simplex, no tones&nbsp; USHPA call sign: WPRY420.</p>

	<p>Amateur Radio Operators: New Mexico's <a href="nm5ml-map.jpg">Mega-Link system</a> 
	provides safe and outstanding coverage over the entire state and west Texas.&nbsp; 
	The CTCSS tone for the system is 100Hz.</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Why use a radio? Proper understanding of how the common 2 meter 
	transceiver works, mastering the skills necessary to use it, and setting up 
	the radio properly can together, at the least, greatly enhance the safety, 
	courtesy, and convenience of those who fly a paraglider or a hang glider. In 
	some instances, it can save a pilot’s life.&nbsp; Always remember to keep 
	transmissions to an absolute minimum.&nbsp; “Chatty” pilots are an annoyance 
	to others.<br>&nbsp;<br>This article is about the setup of the common 2 meter YAESU transceiver.&nbsp; Other YAESU radios, such as the FT-60R, are set up in a similar fashion but have slightly 
	different set values.&nbsp; The popularity of the YAESU radios may be due to the fact that they have some critical functions that are missing in others brands, such as the ICOM.&nbsp; The 
	VX-150/170 is no longer in production and has been replaced by the similar FT-250R/270R.&nbsp; The major difference between the 250R and the 270R is that the latter is submersible (3' of water for 
	3 minutes).</p>
	<h2>Microphone Position</h2>
	<p>One of our pilots observed that "eating" the microphone at 
	the end of the boom on a helmet actually decreases clarity.&nbsp; Placing 
	the mic an inch from the mouth is the correct position for all noise 
	canceling microphones.&nbsp; Thanks, Max Bennett, for this tip!</p>

	more detailed information on using your radio.</p>
	<h2>Set Mode Items of 
	Importance to Pilots</h2>
	<p>Press the “F” key (function key) and then “0” 
	(set key).&nbsp; Rotate the dial until the number you wish to check/change 
	appears at the left of the display.&nbsp; Press the “F” again to toggle 
	between the item description and the value.&nbsp; Change the value by 
	rotating the top right knob.&nbsp; To save, be sure the display is the 
	description, not the value and then press the PTT button to save and return 
	to the mode you left (VFO or MR).&nbsp; For other radios, check their 
	respective manuals.&nbsp; If you have made any changes to your radio, it is 
	always best to completely reset it before making the following changes.&nbsp; 
	On how to do this, see the last paragraph below.</p>
	<h3>Recommended settings</h3>
	<blockquote>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Rx 
	SAVE – OFF (receive save function)  –  default is .25 sec<br>10&nbsp; Tx SAVE 
	– OFF (transmit save function)  –  default is off<br>11&nbsp; APO – 3 hours 
	(automatic power off)  –  default is off<br>22 &nbsp;TOT – 1 minute (transmission 
	time out)  –  default is off<br>32 &nbsp;LK Mode – K + D (all keys &amp; dial locked) 
	 –  default is key only<br>37 &nbsp;BAT check – shows the battery voltage  –  
	recharge if below 7.3V – 7.4V, most radios</blockquote>
	<p>Changing the various 
	set commands from their defaults without thoroughly understanding what you 
	are doing can easily make your radio a nuisance (and even dangerous) to 
	yourself and others, especially #22.</p>
	<h3>Transmit/Receive Save Function</h3>
	<p>Both these set functions save battery power but have significant drawbacks.&nbsp; 
	For example, waiting 2 seconds for your receiver to turn on after it 
	receives a transmission will cause you to lose the first 2 seconds of what 
	is being transmitted.&nbsp; Activating the transmit save function lowers the 
	radio’s transmit level if the prior received signal is very strong.&nbsp; If 
	you are near another pilot and receive a transmission, the next time you 
	transmit, your power level will be lowered greatly.&nbsp; If the other pilot 
	flies away, he won’t hear you as your power level may be too low.&nbsp; It 
	will not correct itself until he contacts you again.&nbsp; Meanwhile, you 
	have no idea whether your transmission was heard or not.&nbsp; It gets more 
	complicated if you have many pilots.&nbsp; Turn these features off!</p>
	
	<h3>APO automatic power off</h3>
	<p>There is nothing more annoying than to be at 
	launch, turn your radio on, and nothing happens.&nbsp; A serious design flaw 
	with YAESU radios is that it is easy to accidently turn your radio on with 
	ordinary handling.&nbsp; If you have this function set correctly the chances 
	of having a dead battery are lessened.&nbsp; The exact time out should be 
	more than the time you expect to be in the air.&nbsp; The APO clock starts 
	from the time of your last transmission.&nbsp; Three hours should be plenty 
	for any pilot.&nbsp; I you are not communicating within a 3 hour period, you 
	probably are not in the air....</p>
	
	<h3>Transmission Time Out Time</h3>
	<p>It is of vital importance to set this feature.&nbsp; Pilots may have a malfunction 
	of their PTT wiring and their radio will transmit until they discover the 
	problem or the battery goes dead.&nbsp; Either way, other pilots may not be 
	able to communicate.&nbsp; Such scenarios can endanger pilot safety as vital 
	information cannot be shared, calls for help received, etc.&nbsp; Setting 
	the TOT correctly (1 min) can help prevent tragedy to say nothing of the 
	annoyance you could be to other pilots.&nbsp; The writer knows of one 
	tragedy (death) that probably could have been avoided if the radios in use 
	had been properly setup and the users had minimal training.</p>
	
	<h3>Transmit power level</h3>
	<p>It is important that other pilots can hear you in the air.&nbsp; 
	Ordinarily, the “mid” setting of 1-2 watts should be used.&nbsp; The “low” 
	setting of .5 watts is not enough to be heard more than a few hundred yards 
	away. The “high” setting, however, will quickly drain your battery and broadcast your signal for a hundred miles.&nbsp; In fact, FCC rules state that you are to only use enough power to maintain 
	adequate communications.&nbsp; To 
	change it, press the “F” key and then “3” (low).&nbsp; Rotate the dial to 
	change the power level.&nbsp; Press “F” key again.&nbsp; Note: The display 
	will read “low” in both the “low” and “mid” power settings.&nbsp; If you can 
	see other pilots the “mid” setting is more than adequate.&nbsp; If you 
	cannot see other pilots, try the “high” setting.</p>
	
	<h3>Locking the Keypad and Dial</h3>
	<p>Radios that are in a pilot’s harness are prone to having various 
	parts pressed hard, including the buttons.&nbsp; It is important that the 
	radio be locked when flying but the right mode must be chosen (both keypad 
	and dial locked).&nbsp; To do this, see above (recommended settings #32) and be sure the mode is “K + 
	D” which means that both the keypad and dial will be locked.&nbsp; On newer 
	radios, you can also prevent any transmissions of the radio (PTT locked).&nbsp; 
	If you choose “ALL” on the newer radios, you won’t be able to transmit!&nbsp; 
	Also, you should turn on the lock mode by pressing the “F” key (function) 
	and #6 (lock).&nbsp; On newer YAESU radios, there is not a separate key to 
	initiate the lock mode.&nbsp; Instead, just hold down the “F” key for a few 
	seconds to lock the radio.&nbsp; A little key icon will appear in the lower 
	right of the display.</p>
	
	<h3>BAT check</h3>
	<p>The VX-150/170 and the 
	FT-250R/270R (unlike the FT-60R) do not display the battery voltage at power 
	on.&nbsp; Do not fly with your battery less 7.3/7.4 volts.&nbsp; Always 
	carry an extra fully charged battery – you might need it, especially if you are injured.</p>
	
	<h3>Memory Operations</h3>
	<p>To save a frequency to memory (YAESU models), 
	get in the VFO mode by pressing #8 (VFO).&nbsp; Repeatedly pressing “VFO” 
	will toggle between the two VFO banks “A” and “B”.&nbsp; Choose one or the 
	other – it doesn’t matter.&nbsp; Dial the frequency you want but without the 
	first number (1). To start over, press the PTT button or power cycle the 
	radio.&nbsp; To save it to memory, hold the “F” for one second and then 
	immediately rotate the dial to pick the memory channel you want. (If the 
	channel is blinking, it already has a frequency stored in it.)&nbsp; Then 
	press the “F” key momentarily again and the frequency will be saved to 
	memory but you will still be in VFO mode.&nbsp; To check what you saved in 
	memory, press the “MR” button.&nbsp; If you press the “MR” twice, the “MR” 
	in the display will blink and the radio will be in temporary VFO mode where 
	you can adjust the displayed frequency up or down.&nbsp; It is easier to do 
	this than to go to VFO mode and then dial in the frequency you want.</p>
	
	<h3>Resetting the radio</h3>
	<p>If you program your radio incorrectly and have no idea 
	what happened or how to fix it, you can reset it.&nbsp; Turn it off, hold 
	down both the PTT button and the lamp button (two buttons below the former) 
	while turning on the radio.&nbsp; It will make an interesting set of beeps.&nbsp; 
	Turn the dial to “ALL.RST”.&nbsp; To reset just the set values, dial 
	“SET.RST”.&nbsp; To reset just the memory, dial “MEM.ONLY”.&nbsp; Now press 
	the “F” key briefly.&nbsp; Power cycle the radio.</p>
	
	<h3>USHPA Radio Authorization</h3>
	<p>This instructor recommends that all pilots complete the USHPA Radio Authorization Study 
	Guide and become certified in the use of the USHPA radio bands.&nbsp; It all 
	takes maybe 15 minutes of time and any USHPA instructor can sign you off.&nbsp; 
	Complete the guide, take the short T/F exam, send USHPA $15, and then be a 
	fully authorized user of the frequencies given us by the FCC.&nbsp; All too 
	often&nbsp; pilots take a scoff-law approach to the use of VHF radios and 
	this can further erode the confidence that various Federal agencies have in 
	FAR 103 pilots.&nbsp; In the end, it can jeopardize the future of our sport 
	or lead to more and costly (for us) regulation.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Use of the Amateur 
	bands by pilots who are not licensed will upset Amateur operators and can 
	result in complaints by them to the FCC.&nbsp; Getting noticed by the FCC is 
	similar to being noticed by the CAB: the pilot will need lots of money 
	(fines) to make either go away.&nbsp; Pilots can always appeal but going 
	before an Administrative Federal Law judge costs about $10,000 because you must 
	have a lawyer.&nbsp; Don't be a nuisance or an idiot -- we already have way too many of these people in our flying community.</p>
