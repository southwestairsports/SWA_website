	<h1>Towing high</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>Are you yearning to get really high on a tow?&nbsp; Sometimes, you may just want to have a 20-30 minute relaxing flight or you see a cloud street in the distance and there is nothing&nbsp; but 
	sink between the tow area and the lift.&nbsp; You need to glide a long way -- a high tow can be the only way to get there.</p>
	<p>Here are some tips to make the tow better.</p>
	<p>1.&nbsp; When you get really high (&gt; 4,000' AGL), you may not be able to see the two vehicle.&nbsp; No problem.&nbsp; The tow operator (TO) knows what to do.&nbsp; Just follow the tow line that 
	is hooked to you.</p>
	<p>2.&nbsp; Make sure your two way-radio is working properly and that your battery is fully charged.&nbsp; The tow operator and others on the ground may lose sight of you.&nbsp; Do not assume they 
	know where you are or where you are going.</p>
	<p>3. Make sure you have your GPS coordinates handy at all times. If you are miles away and need to land, you will have to quickly tell your ground crew or other pilots your coordinates so that 
	they can help you or pick you up.&nbsp; Two-way radios work line of sight and have poor range when used at ground level.</p>
	<p>4. Dress warmly.&nbsp; At the end of the tow it may be 25 degrees cooler than at the earth's surface.</p>
	<p>5. While under tow, do not hesitate to contact the TO if you see something you are not sure about e.g. the tow line going slack or straight down. You can be in strong lift, for example, and the 
	TO will back off the tow force.&nbsp; He can sense what is going on at the winch and will do what will get you as high as possible, safely.</p>
	<p>6. If you get in strong thermal lift, pin off!&nbsp; You will get higher faster that way.&nbsp; If the lift is weak, stay on tow.</p>
	<p>7. If it is convenient, let the TO know when you are ABOUT to pin off.&nbsp; He can prepare the winch for the drogue retrieval. What is most important is for the pilot to say over the radio, 
	"OFF TOW!" when he is no longer under tow.&nbsp; If you are off tow, the longer the TO waits to begin the drogue retrieval, the greater the chance it will hit the ground farther from the winch.&nbsp; 
	Walking for hundreds of yards to find and bring the drogue back wastes time.</p>
	<p>8. Any time you feel uncontrollable panic coming on, PIN OFF!&nbsp; It does not matter if your brain and what is fact are 180 degrees out of sync.&nbsp; It is never safe to be distracted by 
	panic when flying a paraglider, regardless of the reason.&nbsp; The TO cannot see what is going on near you (weather events, equipment issues, etc.). While you are under tow, he is focused on the 
	winch operation which is what keeps the pilot safe.</p>
	<p>9. Always get as high as you can under tow unless you decide to pin off in a thermal.&nbsp; Being higher means you have more options.</p>
