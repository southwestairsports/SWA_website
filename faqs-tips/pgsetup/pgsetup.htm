	<h1>Paragliding (PG) equipment - typical setup</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>We at Southwest Airsports 
	provide valuable and custom information to student pilots concerning what 
	equipment is best for them.&nbsp; They can only get this information at a 
	school like ours.&nbsp; The Internet can be helpful but no one coming to us 
	for training has the experience and skill necessary to make the best 
	decisions concerning such things as gliders, helmets, and harnesses.&nbsp; Mistakes here can result in accidents and injuries or, at the least, be a waste of money.&nbsp; Nor is it particularly 
	ethical to ask us for information on what is the best wing, for example, and then go buy it elsewhere.</p>
	<p>
	Registered flight schools in the U.S. will not sell gliders except to their 
	own students.&nbsp; We do not consider it a good safety measure to show up 
	for training with equipment purchased elsewhere.&nbsp; Student pilots often 
	buy used equipment and later discover defects or problems which interfere 
	with their learning to fly safely.&nbsp; For example, a student will buy a 
	glider rated for "intermediate" pilots and then discovers that he is unable 
	to handle it at his level of skill.&nbsp; He is not happy and we must waste 
	our time doing a repeat training on our school gliders.&nbsp; Your purchase 
	of gear from us helps us offset the real cost of providing you the best 
	training available.&nbsp; We sell everything a pilot needs to fly a 
	paraglider safely.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>You should invest 
	in top quality equipment not just because it works better and lasts longer 
	but because it is increases your margin of safety.</p>
	<p>
Total cost for a typical PG setup is 
	about $6,000 (2015).</p>
	<h2>The wing</h2>
	<p>
Gliders are rated for their ability to recover from collapses 
	while flying.&nbsp; Gliders that have an
	<a href="../PGRating.pdf">LTF</a> "A" rating generally recover spontaneously from collapses.&nbsp; 
	Gliders with higher LTF letter ratings require more pilot input to recover.&nbsp; 
	Collapses often happen when flying in air that has turbulence caused by 
	thermals.&nbsp; In the photo below, each cloud is the top of a thermal  –  
	this was an outstanding day for paragliding.&nbsp; The pilot here, Lee 
	Baker, was the first ever to tow up at the sod farm and thermal away to 
	cloud base.&nbsp; He loved it!&nbsp;&nbsp; Flying early or late in the day 
	minimizes turbulence but flights will be short  –  what is known as a 
	sled-ride.&nbsp; Why do pilots choose wings that require more input to fix 
	problems?&nbsp; It is because these wings have generally higher 
	performance.&nbsp; As mountain pilots here in El Paso, we tend to be very 
	conservative when flying among the rocks and like the more stable wings.&nbsp; 
	In contests, skill usually trumps glider design in all but extreme cases so 
	high performance gliders generally make little difference.&nbsp; 
	$2,500 - $4,300.&nbsp; Cost is based on performance and quality.</p>
	<p>
	We are an <a href="http://www.flyozone.com/">Ozone</a> dealer, you can go to their site for extensive information on the gliders, harnesses, and the accessories they offer.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="paraglider landing near Santa Teresa, NM" height="768" src="0918101035_01.JPG" width="1024">&nbsp;</p>
	<p>What class or wing should I fly?&nbsp; It depends on where you fly most 
	of the time.&nbsp; Pilots who only fly on the coasts will rarely experience 
	turbulent air.&nbsp; On the other hand, pilots who fly in the mountainous 
	desert, like the southwest U.S., can experience&nbsp; the most turbulent air 
	in the world.&nbsp; Training is the most critical for the latter type of 
	pilot, especially having the skills to "read" flying conditions.&nbsp; As a 
	result, we recommend that newer pilots who fly in our region fly only LTF A 
	or DHV 1 gliders.&nbsp; Events can happen so quickly that most average 
	pilots will not have time to respond quickly enough.&nbsp; The lower 
	performing gliders have a much better chance of spontaneous recovery from 
	collapses with minimal pilot input.&nbsp; Our experience has shown that 
	pilots who fly more advanced gliders wish they had not flown them here in 
	the southwest.&nbsp; When our pilots go to the coasts or the eastern (and 
	humid) U.S., they find the air relatively benign in comparison  –  and easy 
	to fly in.</p>
	<h2>The harness</h2>
	<p>It is much like sitting in an easy chair.&nbsp; The small 
	red handle in the lower right is used to deploy the reserve parachute stored 
	under the seat of the harness.&nbsp; The paraglider is attached to the two 
	karabiners in the upper center.&nbsp; The back of the harness contains stiff 
	foam used to protect the back of the pilot in case of a fall.&nbsp; There is 
	also a large zippered storage area along the back of the harness for stowing 
	gear, like the glider packing bag and anything else.&nbsp; The pilot is 
	securely strapped into the harness  –  he cannot fall out!&nbsp; When on the 
	ground, the pilot is able to stand up fairly easily though it is somewhat 
	difficult to run with a harness attached.&nbsp; Once in the air, many 
	harnesses have a foot strap attached so that the pilot can easily place 
	himself firmly in the harness without letting go of the controls of the 
	glider.&nbsp; Some harnesses have the pilot almost in a reclining position 
	while some are very upright.&nbsp; Some are shaped like a pod.&nbsp; These 
	harness are the most comfortable and allow the pilot to be less exposed to 
	the colder air of high altitudes  –  they are also the most expensive and 
	used mostly by serious cross country pilots.&nbsp; Cost: $450 - $1,500.&nbsp; 
	Most pilots spend about $850 on a harness.)</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="paragliding harness" src="harness.jpg" width="300" height="266"></p>
	<h2>The helmet</h2>
	<p>
Most pilots prefer helmets with a faceguard as we tend to 
	hit the ground at many different angles, especially when launching.&nbsp; 
	Who likes to eat dirt and grass or have one's nose rearranged?&nbsp; The
	<a href="http://finsterwalder-charly.de/en/helmets/insider.html">Charly 
	Insider</a> (photo here) is made of
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevlar">Kevlar</a> and is specifically 
	designed and certified to meet the strict standards of the European Union 
	for air sports.&nbsp; How much is your head worth if you go bonk?&nbsp; This 
	should not be a difficult question but it is for too many pilots....&nbsp; 
	Helmets without faceguards should only be used by experienced pilots.&nbsp; 
	Accidents at launch by new pilots tend to involve face plants which is why 
	the faceguard is highly recommended.&nbsp; Cost: $225 - $350</p>
	<p>
<img alt="paragliding helmet" src="PGHelmet.jpg" width="330" height="288"></p>
	<h2>The reserve</h2>
	<p>
Most pilots fly with a reserve just for the mental comfort 
	it brings as we all know that they are only to be used as a last resort.&nbsp; 
	This is because deploying a reserve when things go awry with your main 
	glider is always dicey.&nbsp; (Here is a video of 
	the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAETwwhvkR4">unexpected results</a> that can happen during a deployment.)&nbsp; It is 
	best to never be in a situation where reserve deployment might be necessary!</p>
	<p>
Do NOT fly in air that requires a greater level of skill than what you have.</p>
	<p>
<a href="http://www.apcoaviation.com/products.asp?section=emergency&amp;product=guided_md">Steerable reserves</a> are still in the experimental stages.&nbsp; The 
	demonstrations are always under controlled conditions with a pilot flying a 
	fully inflated and stable glider.&nbsp; If a steerable reserve AND the 
	glider begin to candlestick around each other, it will be much worse than 
	just the glider doing it (a pilot can disable the glider but not the 
	reserve).&nbsp; Therefore, it is ALWAYS wiser to fly with plenty of altitude 
	and do everything possible to fix the problem with your glider before 
	reaching for the reserve.&nbsp; Once under a reserve, you have no control 
	over where you will land and no guarantee how the reserve will deploy.&nbsp; 
	This is why it is a last resort.&nbsp; If you use a reserve, purchase the 
	biggest one you can carry.&nbsp; The finest reserves are made by
	<a href="http://www.highenergysports.com/">High Energy Sports</a> of 
	Anaheim, CA.&nbsp; They have unique aerodynamic properties which greatly 
	slow down the pilot's descent through the air. Here is some
	<a href="../Reserves/reserves.htm">more info on reserve 
	systems</a>.&nbsp; Below is the May Day reserve by
	<a href="http://www.apcoaviation.com/products/7/7mayday.html">APCO Aviation</a>.&nbsp; 
	Cost:&nbsp; $650 - $1,100 (Cost is based on size and type.&nbsp; Most pilots 
	spend $650 - $850 on a reserve like the one below).</p>
	<p>
<img alt="paragliding reserve parachute" src="APCOReserve.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
	<h2>Footwear</h2>
	<p>The most common injury in paragliding is to the ankles.&nbsp; It is 
	important to protect them which is why high top boots are recommended.&nbsp; 
	Boots must never have lacing clips attached as they can snag the lines in 
	and around the harness.&nbsp; You will probably never have a problem if you 
	fly with boots that have open lacing clips.&nbsp; But why complicate a 
	series of cascading events with lines snagged to your boots?&nbsp; A student 
	who knew better got his feet tangled together while trying to land  –  he was 
	lucky he didn't get hurt.&nbsp; The boots here are CRISPI  –  the finest on 
	the market.&nbsp; They have sturdy vertical inserts which help prevent ankle 
	injuries and are light and comfortable.&nbsp; Ordinary hiking boots will 
	also do but if you have weak ankles or want maximum protection for your 
	feet, these boots are worth the investment.&nbsp; They are very durable and 
	will give many years of service, even while hiking.&nbsp; Cost:&nbsp; $330.</p>
	<p>
<img alt="Crispi paragliding boots" src="CrispiBoot.jpg" width="340" height="340"></p>
	<h2>The radio</h2>
	<p>
The radio is far more than a convenience when flying.&nbsp; 
	It is your connection with other pilots and the ground for weather 
	information, pilots in distress, and emergencies.&nbsp; It must be simple 
	and easy to operate.&nbsp; All USHPA pilots have the privilege of their own 
	set of <a href="../ushpa-radio-freqs.pdf">radio frequencies</a> in the 150 MHz range.&nbsp; Inexpensive 2 meter 
	Amateur Radio service transceivers can be modified (we can do this) to work on these 
	frequencies.&nbsp; It is technically against the rules (FCC) to use these 
	modified radios but the authorities are apparently looking the other way at 
	this time.&nbsp; If the FCC wanted to, they could immediately require that 
	these radios have a non-modifiable chipset.&nbsp;
The "legal" radios are 
	expensive and do not easily work with accessories necessary for flying.</p>
	<p>
	Here is a typical 2 meter modifiable radio.&nbsp; We sell them ready to go for USHPA registered 
	pilots.&nbsp; Cost: around $ 190.&nbsp; There is a newer and much cheaper 
	radio made in China called the Bao Feng which costs about $45 on the 
	Internet.&nbsp; It is ready to go.&nbsp; It is not particularly reliable and can be buggy to operate.&nbsp; It is better in the long run to go with the more expensive YAESU radio.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="YAESU FT-250R 2 meter radio" src="FT-250R-thumb.jpg" width="125" height="356"></p>
	<p>
You must also have a speaker and mic 
	that work inside your helmet as it impossible to hear a radio unless it is a 
	few inches from your ear because of wind noise.&nbsp; The best value on the market is the
	<a href="http://www.thermaltracker.com/shop1.htm">Thermal Tracker</a>.&nbsp; 
	Cost is about $130. It should be used with the push button on the helmet.&nbsp; 
	The wrist-button setup works fine but it is a nuisance to hook up and can 
	get tangled in equipment and clothing.&nbsp; If you are too busy to reach 
	over to your helmet and push the talk button, you may be too busy to talk.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Thermal Tracker push to talk headset" src="tracker-opener.jpg" width="540" height="351"></p>
	<p>
Pilots will need to order the correct connection for their particular radio.&nbsp;
	<a href="../../ContactUs/contactus.htm">Contact us</a> if you would like to order a radio or a Thermal. Tracker.&nbsp; 
	We are dealers for both.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</p>
	<h2>GPS</h2>
	<p>
This device is essential if you fly in the mountains as you 
	must always know your speed and direction over the ground.&nbsp; I.e., "Am I 
	drifting backwards over the top of the mountain and into danger?"&nbsp; It 
	is very difficult to tell your speed and direction over the ground if we are 
	a mile or two over it.&nbsp; With a GPS we can tell whether we are starting 
	to slow down and in what direction we are going.</p>
	<p>
If we ever get in 
	trouble with authorities per "you were flying over X" but we were not, the 
	GPS log can prove our innocence (but only if our GPS can log our tracks and 
	we have set it up properly).&nbsp; If a pilot has plenty of money, he can buy a 
	variometer that also has a GPS but those of us who really know and use these 
	devices generally prefer a separate unit which can double for hiking and 
	driving as well.&nbsp; The most common, rugged, and easy to use GPS is the 
	GARMIN top-of-the-line models for hiking, like the
	<a href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?cID=145&amp;pID=63801">Garmin 
	62s</a>.&nbsp; The older Garmin 60csx is also excellent and can be had for a 
	good price on the used market and is still available (as of 2014) new from suppliers on 
	Amazon.&nbsp; Cost: $150 - $350.</p>
	<p>
<img alt="Garmin 60CSX GPS" src="Garmin60csx.jpg" width="300" height="300"></p>
	<h2>Compass</h2>
	<p>
In case we fly into a cloud by accident, a compass can greatly 
	help because it instantly tells us our heading unlike a GPS.&nbsp; That is, 
	we can head to the edge of the cloud and out rather than fly deeper into it.&nbsp; 
	Those who have sailed a yacht in fog know what this means.&nbsp; A GPS is 
	next to useless unless a course is held steady for 5 or 10 seconds.&nbsp; Do 
	NOT use a cheap bubble compass as they go everywhere if you are in 
	turbulence.&nbsp; Do NOT mount the compass next to a GPS as the magnetic 
	field in the GPS will effect the compass and vice versa.&nbsp; The photo 
	here is an inexpensive Brunton compass.&nbsp; Cost $15 - $30</p>
	<p>
&nbsp;
	<img alt="Brunton compass" src="compass.jpg" width="274" height="274"></p>
	<h2>The variometer</h2>
	<p>
If you want to thermal well, you must have one of 
	these, preferably one that also has a recorder.&nbsp; The variometer (or 
	vario) measures your vertical speed through the air instantaneously.&nbsp; 
	It gives an easy visual indication as well as a varying tone, if the pilots 
	wants.&nbsp; It can even give an audio tone indicating when the pilot is in 
	sink.&nbsp; The vario also can tell you your relative altitude, your actual 
	altitude, air temperature, and (optional) airspeed.&nbsp; A GPS can give 
	vertical speed but only for descending.&nbsp; A recording variometer records 
	everything from your flight.&nbsp; You can then download the data to your 
	computer and analyze your flight carefully.&nbsp; How well did I thermal 
	today?&nbsp; Only a recording variometer can give you the details.&nbsp; 
	Here is a photo of the Flytec 6010.&nbsp; Please
	<a href="../../ContactUs/contactus.htm">contact us</a> for pricing and more information.&nbsp; Cost:&nbsp; $285 - 
	$1,400 (Cost is based on functions desired.&nbsp; A recording variometer 
	that is easy to read costs about $ 450.)</p>
	<p>
<img alt="Flytec paragliding variometer" src="Vario.jpg" width="168" height="300"></p>
	<h2>Flight deck</h2>
	<p>It is difficult to mount a GPS, a Vario, a compass, and a 
	camera somewhere on your legs with straps.&nbsp; Instead, use a flight deck.&nbsp; 
	It has various compartments for things like a camera, snacks, weapons, 
	matches, first aid, etc.&nbsp; It mounts with straps to the webbing next to 
	the karabiners on the harness.&nbsp; It is easy to take it on and off.&nbsp; 
	Below is a photo of the Sol flight deck.&nbsp; Cost: $99</p>
	<p>
<img alt="SOL paragliding flight deck" src="solflightdeck.jpg" width="200" height="200"></p>
	<h2>Radio harness</h2>
	<p>This is optional but has the advantage of securely attaching your radio 
	to your person and protecting it.&nbsp; It also has a convenient pouch that 
	can be used for storing extra batteries.&nbsp; You can use a flight deck to 
	store batteries but you have to fuss with a zipper in flight which can take 
	two hands.&nbsp; The radio pouch has a Velcro flap which is easy to open.&nbsp; Another 
	advantage of the radio harness is that you will often find yourself on the 
	ground without your harness and flight deck on and in need of radio 
	communications.&nbsp; The radio harness makes it easy to safely and securely 
	carry your radio at all times. Cost:&nbsp;about $50</p>
	<p>
<img alt="paraglidiing radio harness" src="MFJ-18t.jpg" width="140" height="166"></p>
	<h2>Other equipment</h2>
	<p>Things like a two-step speed bar, flight suit, <a href="gloves.htm">gloves</a>, 
	<a href="../Catheter/cath.htm">catheters</a>, etc. can be useful, depending on conditions and where/when you are flying.</p>
	<h2>Used gear</h2>
	<p>Used wings can offer a significant savings but will not have 
	the life of new as fabric and lines decay with age and exposure to the sun.&nbsp; 
	If you plan to fly more than 30 hours a year, new gear is a better value as 
	you will not have to replace it before its useful life is up.</p>
	<p>It is 
	important to remember that your life depends on the safety and condition of 
	the gear you fly with.&nbsp; Used gear (other than from reputable dealers 
	and schools) has unknown origin and usage.&nbsp; How much is your life and 
	safety worth?&nbsp; Do not buy used wings or reserves without having them 
	inspected by factory authorized inspection centers.&nbsp; Sellers of such 
	equipment should be happy to share the cost of an official inspection.</p>
	<h2>Gear size &amp; weight</h2>
	<p>
PG gear is so lightweight and compact that 
	it can go as regular baggage on commercial jets.&nbsp; With some models, 
	your entire aircraft with instruments and safety equipment can fit in a 
	small back pack that will fit in the overhead bin on a small plane.&nbsp; 
	The average weight of a complete paragliding setup is about 45 lbs.</p>
