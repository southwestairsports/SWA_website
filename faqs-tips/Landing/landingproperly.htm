	<h1>Landing a paraglider safely and comfortably</h1>
		<p>by Had Robinson<br><br>In the video
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Reah6zO-0">here</a>, the 
		pilot is landing with a paramotor and a fast reflex type wing (the 
		Paramania GTR).&nbsp; Flying without a paramotor and with an ordinary PG 
		glider makes a landing easier in some ways.</p>
	<p>I have verified with a sensitive pressure recorder (a variometer) on the ground that there is a pressure 
		wave of lift from 20 to 40 ft./min. just in front of the glider as it skims along the ground.&nbsp; This provides additional lift just before landing.</p>
	<p>A pilot does not "fall out of the air".&nbsp; As long as the glider is 
		moving, it has lift.&nbsp; So, when his feet first touch the ground, it 
		is not as if he was jumping off a ladder.</p>
	<p>Read the notes below and then study 
		the video.<br></p>
	<h2>Flare timing<br></h2>
	<p>When landing, most newer pilots apply too much brake 
		too early and, as a consequence, have harder landings.&nbsp; It is a 
		natural reaction to "falling out of the sky" but it is not correct for a 
		number of reasons.&nbsp; The faster a glider is moving, the 
		more energy it has, and the greater authority it will have when inputs 
		(like a landing flare) are made.<br><br>Flare timing is 
		critical.&nbsp; Look closely at the hands in the video.&nbsp; Just 
		before touching down, the pilot feels for the wing's flare authority by 
		applying a small and brief amount of brake.</p>
	<p>When should a pilot start the flare?</p>
	<p>With high performance models, such as an LTF C or reflex glider, it is best to flare just before the the feet touch the ground.&nbsp; The glider will slow down some and be in min sink.</p>
	<p>If your glider has more passive safety built in (lower performance), you will be less able to harness the energy of the glider when making the flare.&nbsp; In this case, start the flare sooner 
	when a few feet above the ground.&nbsp; If you can come in with a full wrap or more of the brakes but no brakes applied (hands fully up), it will help with the flare.</p>
	<h2>Amount of flare</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;Every wing is 
		different in how it responds.&nbsp; Some gliders require very little 
		flare, such as the reflex wing in the video.&nbsp; Non-reflex gliders used by PG pilots need more flare and it should be applied earlier.&nbsp; Generally, beginner-type gliders require the 
		most flare and it must be aggressive and deep.</p>
	<p>Once the flare has begun, more brake may be applied to redirect some of the horizontal motion into vertical.&nbsp; Done just right, the pilot will land with very little, if any, downward force 
	when contacting the ground.</p>
	<p>If the flare is too deep, the glider will jump up and then stall, producing a harder landing.&nbsp; This is often a problem for students moving into higher performance gliders.</p>
	<p>After sensing the wing's 
		characteristics, the pilot in the video applies a little brake  â€“  enough to slow down the 
		descent rate just a small amount before his feet touch the ground.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;Pilots will not do a face-plant when landing because 
		the glider is still flying and providing some lift, including stability.<br><br>It is important to keep the glider 
		right overhead and centered at all times when landing until the pilot is ready to 
		bring it down.&nbsp; Do not land in such a place that you are unsure of 
		the terrain.&nbsp; A rock hidden in tall grass can result in an injury.&nbsp; If you are landing in or near bushes, bring your glider down accordian style by pulling on one brake enough to 
	spin the glider so that it comes down tip to tip rather than fully on the trailing edge.</p>
