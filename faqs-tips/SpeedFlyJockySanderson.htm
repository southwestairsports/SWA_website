	<h1>Speed to Fly: A Complete Guide to Cross Country Paragliding</h1>
		<p>With Jocky Sanderson (sadly, this video is no longer available)</p>
	<p>
Excerpts taken from the video by Had Robinson.&nbsp; This is expert 
	advice for doing well in cross country paragliding.</p>
	<p>1. It’s Ok to bury the brakes in the core of thermals</p>
	<p>2. Always weight shift away from the hill for safety.</p>
	<p>3. Better lift in thermals is almost always upwind – Thermals drift 
	downwind, especially if they are weak. The strong thermals will be upwind of 
	the weak ones which are drifting back with the wind.&nbsp; HR: Occasionally, you 
	may launch into an area that has no thermal triggers. The triggers may be at 
	or near launch. In this case you may want to fly back to launch and look for 
	the strong thermals there.</p>
	<p>4. Stay in the weak thermal if it drifts. At one point (the thermal 
	trigger), the thermal will break loose and up you go.</p>
	<p>5. When entering lift – WAIT for four (4) seconds and THEN turn. Four (4) seconds is 
	the time it takes to do a full 360 degree turn to stay in the lift section.&nbsp; HR:&nbsp; See #10 below for exceptions.</p>
	<p>6. When in the thermal, if you feel your wing drop, that side is near the 
	edge of the thermal. Fly straight for a few seconds to stay away from the 
	sinky air.</p>
	<p>7. Listen to your vario!&nbsp; Learn its tune.</p>
	<p>8. Never leave lift unless you can see better lift elsewhere and can 
	glide to it. If you see better lift, get there ASAP.&nbsp; HR:&nbsp; What Jockey means is that you will see better sources of thermals (and lift).&nbsp; However, you may see the top of a thermals 
	(a cloud) what indicates that the thermal is strong.</p>
	<p>9. Avoid shade.</p>
	<p>10. Strong thermals: Turn SOONER (&lt;4 seconds) so you don’t fall out the 
	back.</p>
	<p>11. If you do fall out of a thermal, increase the diameter of your circle 
	and you will have a better chance of finding the core again.</p>
	<p>12. If you hit the core, it’s OK to bank hard in order to take the 
	stronger lift.&nbsp; HR:&nbsp; That is, bring the brakes down to the karabiners -- bury them.</p>
	<p>13. Focus when thermalling but chill on glide. We can only concentrate 
	hard for about 20 minutes of every hour.</p>
	<p>14. On glide – eat a snack. If forces you to relax.</p>
	<p>15. Use OUTSIDE brake to monitor your turns. Do not dive into the turn 
	when thermalling/coring.</p>
	<p>16. When hitting a HOT core, don’t fear – turn negative into positive:</p>
	<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
		<li>You are going up!</li>
		<li>The wing is more highly loaded = good.</li>
		<li>Give a good laugh – it’s a ride and it is safe fun. Fear is BAD!</li>
		<li>Fly in groups.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Breathe deeply! Assume an attack attitude and not a defensive.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>17. Fly straight when you reach cloud base – towards your next waypoint.</p>
	<p>18. Working a good cloud:</p>
	<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
		<li>Dark base</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Well defined size</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Has a delta shape.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>19. Decaying cloud:</p>
	<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
		<li>Has an upside down delta shape</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Has wispy edges.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>19. Spend time on the ground studying the course. It pays off!</p>
	<p>20. Patience is important! NEVER say die! Don’t get stuck – you will then 
	be close to the leaders.</p>
	<p>21. Cloud streets: They are good because you don’t have to fly as high.</p>
	<p>22. View competitors as LIFT MARKERS, not threats.</p>
	<p>23. On glide, go STRAIGHT and don’t turn in weak lift, wait for the 
	strong thermal.</p>
	<p>24. THREE RULES OF GLIDER CONTROL:</p>
	<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
		<li>Course correction after a collapse – use the energy of the dive to 
		roll yourself away onto a steady course. And then pump out the collapse, 
		if necessary. Steer and clear!</li>
		<li>If the glider DIVES forward, brake it but then ease off the brakes.</li>
		<li>If you don’t know what to do, ease off the brakes and let the glider 
		fly. If it dives, check the dive and then ease off the brakes.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>25. Comfort is very important – you can’t compete if you are not relaxed.</p>
	<p>26. Stanwell Park, Australia – fabulous place to fly. Smooth air for 100 
	km.</p>
	<p>27. St Andre, France – another outstanding place to fly.</p>
	<p>28. Valadares, Brazil – best place on earth to fly. No crazy winds, just 
	regular air most of the time.</p>
