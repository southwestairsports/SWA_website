	<h1>SPOT Introduction for Soaring Pilots</h1>
		<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
The official SPOT help page is not too much help in setting up the 
	SPOT details if you are a pilot.&nbsp; Here is a simple plan that will help 
	both the pilot and those he wishes to keep informed of his whereabouts and 
	safety.&nbsp; While studying the information below, please refer to the 
	print screen below that I took of my shared SPOT web page.&nbsp; Always 
	remember that the SPOT has to be activated by the pilot.&nbsp; No news from 
	the SPOT does not necessarily mean things are OK.&nbsp; Injured pilots may 
	not be able to press buttons on the SPOT.&nbsp; Emergency procedures should 
	take this in mind.&nbsp; The routine discussed here addresses this inherent 
	weakness in the SPOT system.&nbsp; Single point of failure is a serious 
	problem in a communications loop and we pilots should always have backup 
	means of contacting others.</p>
	<blockquote>
		Warning:&nbsp; Extensive testing in controlled conditions has revealed 
		that there are rare times when the satellite system will not receive 
		transmissions from the SPOT.&nbsp; I advise that pilots not launch until 
		they have verified that the SPOT has communicated with the satellite 
		system.&nbsp; This can be easily done by sending the SPOT messages to 
		your own cell or satellite phone.&nbsp; In a word, the SPOT system is 
		not 100% reliable and pilots should have alternate means of 
		communicating with the outside world.&nbsp; I estimate that the time 
		when SPOT communications are "blacked out" is approximately 1% of the 
		time.&nbsp; Resending messages until the system receives them seems to 
		be the only method that works at this time.&nbsp; I have been in 
		locations outside the U.S. when the SPOT system was unavailable for 
		hours.</blockquote>
	<p>If something goes wrong, you want those who can help to be as informed as 
	possible  –  and why I created this documentation.<br><br>The SOS button may 
	not get a response  –  much like car alarms going off in the night.&nbsp; 
	Maybe it is a real alarm?&nbsp; Maybe not?&nbsp; It can be the latter 
	response at operation centers in backward countries.&nbsp; They often do not 
	have trained people manning the phones at their search and rescue (S&amp;R)operation 
	centers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, these positions are filled with relatives and friends, 
	sad to say, who do not know what they are doing.<br><br>An example of 
	incompetence at this level was the Malaysian Airlines disaster.&nbsp; This 
	was a commercial passenger jet full of people that just disappeared.&nbsp; 
	Recently, a pilot buddy of mine had a serious accident in a South American 
	country, pushed his SPOT SOS button, but never got a response.&nbsp; 
	Thankfully, a friend was nearby who was able to call for an ambulance.&nbsp; 
	Getting hurt in most places in the world can be dicey  –  especially if you 
	are alone.&nbsp; I am sorry to say that in most places, an injured person is 
	prey for the thieves that inhabit most governments and cultures from the top 
	to the bottom.&nbsp; If these people think they can profit from rescuing an 
	injured pilot, they will help.&nbsp; If you are able to waive a credit card 
	around, you will probably be OK.&nbsp; If you are unconscious and alone, it 
	may be another story.&nbsp; You will most likely be robbed and left for 
	dead.&nbsp; It is another reason why traveling and flying alone outside of 
	western countries is dangerous.&nbsp; But our sport seems to attract people 
	who like to take serious risks without regard to either cascading events 
	or what happens next after you hit the ground, have bones sticking out, and 
	are bleeding&nbsp;uncontrollably....<br><br>Authorized persons can get 
	various text messages from the SPOT system sent to their cell phones and/or 
	to email.&nbsp; If an authorized person receives an email, he will also have 
	a link to your SPOT location on Google Maps.&nbsp; These messages and the 
	Track Progress messages are visible on the shared SPOT web page that the 
	user created.&nbsp; There is also a smart-phone application called "The SPOT 
	App" that is available for androids and iPhones.<br><br>Some uninformed 
	person recently asked this pejorative rhetorical question on a SPOT user 
	blog, "What good is this [expletive] app on your smartphone?&nbsp; You know 
	where you are!"&nbsp; It is simple: maybe you might want to give your phone 
	to somebody else so they can find your body if you have an accident.&nbsp; 
	Or someone who cares about your backside can install the app, login as you, 
	and see where you are.&nbsp; It is a great concept to let people who care about you to know 
	your location in as many ways as possible rather than depend on dumb luck 
	for them to figure out where you are or for help to come.&nbsp; Contrary to 
	the popular movies, may not come unless you take 
	every precaution to ensure that it does.</p>
	<p>Another knucklehead was angry why SPOT must have a user's active credit card on file at all times.&nbsp; The reason: if your SPOT is misused (a rogue SOS message sent), SPOT and the appropriate 
	agencies will bill that credit card.&nbsp; Think about it:&nbsp; do not let your kid play with your SPOT, etc.</p>
	<h2>Initial Setup</h2>
	<p>1.&nbsp; Take a look at the SPOT <a href="Connect_QSG_combo.pdf">setup instructions</a>.</p>
	<p>2.&nbsp; <a href="https://login.findmespot.com/spot-main-web/activation/step0.html">Activate your SPOT</a>.&nbsp; I suggest using only lithium type AAA batteries in your SPOT.&nbsp; Always 
	carry a spare set of batteries with you.</p>
	<p>3. On the SPOT website, click on the "My Devices" tab and setup your SPOT messages.&nbsp; Start with the "Check In/OK" box.&nbsp; The screen should look like the one here.&nbsp; See the text 
	below for the suggested messages to enter on your SPOT.&nbsp; If you fly in different places that have different contact info, you can create additional profiles.&nbsp; </p>
	<p><img alt="sample SPOT My Device setup page" src="SPOTMyDevicePage.jpg"></p>
	<p>3.&nbsp; Be sure to test your SPOT once you have set it up.&nbsp; All features can be tested EXCEPT the SOS function.</p>
	<h2>TEXT MESSAGES THAT SPOT CAN SEND</h2>
	<p>Below are sample text messages that can be sent to the authorized cell 
	phone numbers and/or email addresses. It is relatively simple to setup a 
	profile on the "my SPOT devices" page.&nbsp; What is helpful is that SPOT 
	can send text messages to any cell phone, e.g., 222-333-4444@txt.att.net.<br>
	<br>The SPOT messages need to be simple, short, and to the point, as here in 
	these examples.&nbsp; You must have your name in the message.&nbsp; You want 
	to let your contacts know that you are about to fly and then you MUST let 
	them know you have safely landed.&nbsp; If these messages go to a satellite 
	phone, they must be as short as possible so as not to get truncated by the 
	SAT system.&nbsp; The user name should be FirstnameLastnameInitial e.g. JoeP.&nbsp;
	<br><br>Here are some samples (within quotes) which can be created by the 
	SPOT user.&nbsp; All messages must be as brief and SHORT as possible!<br><br>1. Check in/OK – “SPOT msg JoeP launching”<br><br>2. 
	Custom Message – “SPOT msg JoeP landed All OK”<br><br>3. Help – “SPOT 
	msg JoeP activated need help function. Call [somebody + number]”<br><br>Sending the 
	"need help" message should be used if you need help from your contacts and 
	it is NOT an emergency.&nbsp; An example would be if you sprained your ankle 
	and cannot move about well.&nbsp; <br><br>There is one other message, the 
	SOS message, which is sent to the local search and rescue authorities, as 
	well as those who are authorized, such as a family member or close friend.</p>
	<p><span class="auto-style1">It should only be used for life threatening emergencies or serious injuries.</span></p>
	<p>In the U.S. and European Union, the SOS message will be processed and teams sent out.&nbsp; 
	However, nearly everywhere else, maybe it will happen, maybe not.&nbsp; If anyone 
	receives the SOS message, he should check to be sure S&amp;R has been activated.&nbsp; 
	The more backward/corrupt the country, the less likely the SPOT people will 
	be able to ensure you get help.<br><br>Pilots should invest in search and 
	rescue insurance e.g. SPOT ASSIST or <a href="https://www.globalrescue.com/">Global Rescue</a>, especially if they travel outside the U.S.&nbsp; 
	It is a minimal investment if you ever have a problem.&nbsp; If you activate 
	the SOS message and do not have such insurance, be prepared to pay a 
	hefty bill for your rescue no matter where you are.&nbsp; You may be abandoned by local S&amp;R in other countries if you cannot produce a credit card or refuse to pay up-front.<br><br>Unless you 
	have the Gen3 SPOT, I recommend that pilots not enable the tracking function before sending the 
	“check in/OK” message for that day.&nbsp; This will extend the life of your batteries.</p>
	<p>Just before I leave the earth, I press the 
	track button.&nbsp; Every ten minutes, the SPOT will report my position on 
	the earth (but not altitude). This type of message is “Track Progress” and 
	there can be none or many of these.&nbsp; Depending on conditions, the 
	satellite may receive all or most of your transmitted positions.&nbsp; The 
	moment I land I press (if I am able) the custom message button and it gives 
	the custom message and says “HR safely landed All OK.”<br><br>If a pilot is 
	unable to press the custom message button, the SPOT will continue sending 
	“track progress” messages until the batteries go dead or for (24) hours, 
	whichever happens first.&nbsp; Unless the pilot is carried off (or forced to 
	move), the location should stay the same.&nbsp; That is, the track progress 
	messages will have the same coordinates until the batteries go dead or the 
	pilot (or someone) shuts off the SPOT … or the pilot is moved.&nbsp; The 
	Gen3 SPOT, however, only sends coordinates if it is moved.&nbsp; For this 
	reason its batteries will last longer.<br><br>I highly recommend that 
	pilots send messages in this order:&nbsp; <br><br>1. Check in/OK when about 
	to launch<br>2. Track Progress (which may not exist if I have a very short 
	flight) just before launch<br>3. Custom Message immediately after landing<br>
	<br>If, for some reason, the pilot reverses #1 and #3 messages, it will be 
	obvious to those who receive the messages.&nbsp; That is, the time of 
	landing will be before the time of launch  –  an impossibility.</p>
	<h2>EMERGENCY PROCEDURES</h2>
	<p>It is important that your contacts, especially your coordinator, study these emergency procedures carefully.&nbsp; You can also <a href="EmergencyProcedures.pdf">download a PDF copy</a> of 
	these emergency procedures, print them out, and give them to others.</p>
	<p>1. If your contacts receive (or see) a “Check in/OK” message <span class="auto-style1">but nothing 
	more after about (4) hours</span> (pilots rarely fly longer than that), something 
	has happened – probably not good.&nbsp; If you do fly for longer periods, be sure to let your contacts know this beforehand!&nbsp; If you have more than one contact, 
	you should authorize just one person (and a backup) to coordinate things.&nbsp; 
	Here is what the coordinator should do:<br><br>2. Access the <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0x1gqHEWZP62ZujsyBE9yJEOl54ofmGIX">shared web site</a> (the link 
	here points to my site).&nbsp; Keep 
	any tracking information available.&nbsp; Attempt to determine the time and 
	coordinates of the pilot's last location.&nbsp; Study the tracking information carefully.&nbsp; (At the end of this page is a section on how to read the shared web site.)</p>
	<p>3. If the track messages show a continual change in location with no two locations the same, things are probably OK and the pilot is flying a very long time.&nbsp; Everything is OK if the 
	tracking information makes sense = continually moving with no breaks in time and with the location constantly changing.&nbsp; If there are breaks in the location or the location does not change, it 
	may mean that the pilot is not in the air or has crashed.&nbsp; It is 
	critical that rescue contacts know this.&nbsp; If things do not appear normal, proceed.<br><br>4. Attempt to contact the pilot via 
	radio, cell phone, or satellite phone. How 
	long should someone attempt to contact the pilot?&nbsp; It is hard to say 
	but probably until contact is made one way or another.&nbsp; If there is someone handy, he can go to the last known location of the pilot using the coordinates give by the SPOT and a GPS.&nbsp; If 
	all is OK, the pilot can be rebuked for being a hazard and very irritating for causing a 
	false alarm because he did not check in.&nbsp; Attempt to contact 
	friends or the host that the pilot is traveling with. If it is not possible to contact the pilot, proceed.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>5. If there are 
	track messages with the same location as the Check in/OK message, there has 
	probably been an accident at launch. Initiate search and rescue (S&amp;R) but only if the pilot does not have a rescue service (e.g. Global Rescue).&nbsp; If he does, contact the service 
	immediately and let them take over the rescue.&nbsp; Global Rescue and firms that do similar things are not search organizations.&nbsp; If they have to search for the pilot, he will be charged 
	accordingly.&nbsp; Be sure to tell the service everything you know.&nbsp; If the pilot has no rescue service, proceed.<br><br>6.&nbsp;If the track messages show a change in location and, at some 
	point, show the same location for over 30 minutes, the pilot has crashed. 
	Initiate S&amp;R.<br><br>7. If the track messages are as in #3 above but there are 
	time breaks not compatible with orderly movement and the location starts changing again, the pilot has been 
	rescued or, perhaps, seized. Something is wrong.&nbsp; Initiate S&amp;R.&nbsp; They may already be helping and will know about the rescue.&nbsp; It does not hurt to contact them for instructions and 
	other help.<br><br>If 
	there is any way possible for the pilot to contact help, he must do so if 
	there are problems.<br><br>If the SPOT goes dead where the pilot cannot send the 
	custom message indicating all is OK, he should do everything possible to let 
	everyone know that he is OK.&nbsp; However, a pilot should always carry 
	spare batteries for the SPOT so this should never happen.</p>
	<h2>SHARED SPOT WEB PAGE EXPLANATION</h2>
	<p>Here is my shared page:
	<a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0x1gqHEWZP62ZujsyBE9yJEOl54ofmGIX">
	http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0x1gqHEWZP62ZujsyBE9yJEOl54ofmGIX</a>.&nbsp; It would help to print the page in order to better study it with the information given 
	below.<br>
	<br>If you have not used your SPOT recently, the shared page will throw an 
	error because there is no data.&nbsp; Do not be alarmed.<br><br>Track 
	Progress messages are only visible on the web page and cannot be sent to a 
	cell phone.&nbsp; However, the smart-phone app for the SPOT can display Track Progress 
	messages.<br><br>The map section of the shared SPOT page is not much help, 
	at least for pilot use.&nbsp; As a pilot switches from on the earth to in 
	the air, it makes the map even less helpful.&nbsp; The map section is only 
	useful if whoever needs the info knows which track point to use.&nbsp; For 
	the non-pilot, significant other, etc. it can be a puzzle.<br><br>The 
	“messages” part of the info on the shared web site is the valuable section.<br>
	<br>Note the sample screenshot below, lower left, where it is says “Hadley 
	Robinson is about to launch”. The type of message is “check in/OK”. In the 
	live screen, you would click the “+” to see the details.&nbsp; This is the 
	beginning of my flying activity for that day.&nbsp; I always send that 
	message when I am at launch and will be launching into the air shortly.&nbsp; 
	I also verify that the messages have been received by the SPOT system via my 
	own cell or satellite phone.<br><br>The screenshot shows a jumble of points 
	connected by lines. These points are not useful without analyzing the 
	messages section. It shows a (30) minute flight with the launch and landing 
	points. You know that I have landed because I pressed the custom message 
	button.&nbsp; However, I did not turn off tracking.&nbsp; Why was this?&nbsp; 
	I was in the middle of nowhere and, in case I might be attacked or be 
	injured, I wanted the tracking going while I was on the ground.<br><br>The 
	track points become jammed together because I am walking. If you were on the 
	actual web site you could zoom in and see how far I walked in ten minutes. 
	But then the points appear to jump from 36 to 41. The reason is that I am 
	stationary from points 36 to 40, about 40 minutes.&nbsp; (The new Gen3 SPOT 
	stops sending track points if you stop moving.) Then point 41 appears a long 
	way from point 36. This indicates I am moving fast (in a truck) so the 
	points are way apart. The last point is 42 and there are no more. This means 
	that is the location where I turned off the SPOT or stopped tracking. In the 
	case here I was back at my truck and on my way home. There is no worry 
	because I sent the Custom Message that I am safely landed. If something were 
	to happen after I had landed, I would push the help or SOS button, if I 
	could. <br><br>On the live screen, if you move your mouse over a message in 
	the message section, the relevant track point on the map will radiate out 
	curved lines, like a radio beacon. There is no way to match the numbers next 
	to the track point and the message in the messages section. The track point 
	numbers are consecutive over time. However, clicking on a track point will 
	pop up a screen with the details (see the pop up below) as follows:<br><br>
	1. User name<br>2. ID of the SPOT<br>3. Type of message<br>4. Global 
	coordinates of the location of the SPOT<br>5. The exact time the message was 
	sent in LOCAL TIME<br>6. The state of the SPOT batteries<br><br>The SPOT is 
	a useful device to help keep others informed if you are engaging in 
	activities away from civilization.&nbsp; It is a good investment to get help 
	quickly.&nbsp; However, everyone should have backup means to contact people 
	on the outside e.g., two-way radio, cell, or satellite phone. Single point 
	of failure in any communications scheme should be avoided at all costs, 
	especially since the SPOT has proven not to be 100% reliable.</p>
