	<h1>Low on fuel</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>What should a PPG pilot do if he finds himself far from home and running low on fuel?</p>
	<p>Running out of fuel can be really inconvenient, especially if you fly in places like we do where there are few roads, non-existent cell phone service, and not many people.&nbsp; You 
	miscalculated your fuel supply or forgot to check it.&nbsp; What can you do?</p>
	<p>Did you carry a SPOT or some reliable way to contact others if you are in real trouble?&nbsp; I hope so.&nbsp; Hopefully, you did not seriously miscalculate the amount of fuel in your tank.</p>
	<p>1. If it is during the early part of the day, you can do what we PG pilots do: get a free ride from any thermals.&nbsp; If you do not know how to thermal, any good PG school can teach you how.&nbsp; 
	The beauty of PPG is that a PG pilot can be a thermal hunter in ways he could never do without a paramotor.</p>
	<p>2. If you do not know how to thermal or are flying at the end of the day, you can extend your distance about 10-15% by taking advantage of the pressure wave created at the front of the glider.&nbsp; 
	However, it is of no benefit except when flying right next to the ground.&nbsp; In tests, I have measured a pressure gradient directly beneath and in front of the glider equivalent to lift of from 
	20 to 40 ft./min.&nbsp; Observant pilots will likely discover on their own that less throttle is needed when flying within a few feet of the surface.&nbsp; Hopefully, the terrain will generally 
	allow this type of flight.</p>
	<p>Thankfully, if you must land in remote areas, your gear will be safe and you can leave it and then enjoy a nice hike through the wilderness.&nbsp; You did bring a GPS, extra batteries, water, 
	and a compass, right?</p>
