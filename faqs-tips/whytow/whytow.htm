	<h1>Tow Training – Why and how we train via tow rather than at a hill</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>All courses include tow instruction with our pay-in/pay-out fully hydraulic winch.&nbsp; The advantage of a fully hydraulic system, the most expensive of all winches, is that tow forces can be 
	precisely regulated at all times.&nbsp; This greatly adds to the safety of every launch and tow to altitude.</p>
	<p>Below is a photo of our hydraulic operated winch used by Southwest Airsports to tow up ultralights.&nbsp; The 4 cycle, twin cylinder engine achieves about 25 horsepower and is connected to a pump, the heart 
	of the system.&nbsp; Hydraulic fluid is routed through various valves to a servomotor connected to the aluminum drum which holds nearly 10,000' of Dyneema line.&nbsp; The servomotor is heavy duty 
	and is commonly 
	used to drive the front wheels on (4) wheel drive farm and industrial tractors.&nbsp; Our winch is primarily used at the sod farms as a pay-in type winch.</p>
	<p>The winch can also be used as a 
	pay-out winch.&nbsp; In pay-in mode, the line goes out 1/4 mile to a truck on the other side of the sod farm which has a tall mast with a big pulley at the top.&nbsp; The line goes through the pulley and all the way back to the winch area.&nbsp; In 
	this way, the tow operator has a clear view of the pilot during the launch segment of the flight and can adjust the tow force (or stop it), accordingly.</p>
	<p>The tow pressure is adjusted by 
	varying the hydraulic pressure to the servomotor.&nbsp; There is a special valve (in the right hand of the operator in the photo below) which, if there is some foreign object in the system, will 
	instantly dump the pressure.&nbsp; This is one of a number of failsafe devices on the winch.&nbsp; If all else fails, the tow operator has a hook knife with which he can quickly cut the tow line.&nbsp; 
	The tow operator/flight instructor maintains constant contact with the towed pilot via radio.&nbsp; The instructor and pilot each have multiple radios to insure contact is never lost while in 
	flight.&nbsp; Just the same, pilots are instructed that if, for some reason, they cease to hear commands they must immediately release from tow and land somewhere safe.</p>
	<p><img alt="hydraulic winch used by Southwest Airsports " height="768" src="IMG_2182_01.JPG" width="1024">&nbsp;</p>
	<p>When being towed up at the sod farms, landings can be made in virtually any direction, depending on wind 
	direction, unlike being at a small hill.&nbsp; Under tow, pilots can go much 
	higher: 2-3 times as high as the average training hill of 300'.&nbsp; This 
	means more time in the air to do training maneuvers.&nbsp; The advantage of the tow system is that we can simulate many of the various conditions pilots will experience at a launch site without 
	the hazards.</p>
	<p>The downside of towing is that new pilots will not experience the mental challenges of launching from a cliff site.&nbsp; Peering over the edge of a sharp cliff that you are about to run off of 
	can be daunting.&nbsp; Consequently, our training also require pilots to successfully launch from one of our many mountain sites located on public lands, primarily of the Bureau of Land Management 
	and the State of Texas.</p>

	<p>
	<img alt="paraglider pilot preparing to tow" src="IMG_2138.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>
How to launch via towing is also an important skill to have before attending 
	SIV clinics. At these clinics, a pilot is towed 1,000’s of feet into the air 
	over water in order to safely practice special maneuvers that might be 
	needed in flight.&nbsp; Pilots who learn towing at clinics for the first 
	time can be distracted and surprised by the tow operation itself.&nbsp; As a 
	result, they can lose focus on the main purposes of the clinic.</p>
	<p>Weather often makes towing the difference between PG pilots staying on 
	the ground or flying.&nbsp; A training hill only works with winds from a 
	certain direction.&nbsp; When we tow, winds can be from any direction or 
	calm.&nbsp; We are fortunate to have the space in this region to offer this 
	unique resource without having to travel for half a day. Our towing area is 
	close to the west side of El Paso, TX.</p>
	<p>
Being towed for the first 
	time can be a safer and more relaxed environment for new powered paragliding 
	pilots. Learning how to control both the paramotor and glider at the same 
	time can be overwhelming. With towing, the pilot can progress safely from 
	one phase to another.</p>
	<p>
	Hooking up to the tow line. The orange drogue parachute is connected to 
	the tow line. It helps us find the end of the tow line after the pilot 
	disconnects in flight. Pilot safety is our primary concern and everything is 
	done with that in mind.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="paraglider pilot hooking up to the tow line" src="../../training/general-training-info/2155.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>
We are pleased to offer this valuable and unique 
	resource in all of our basic courses. All towing is done by USHPA certified 
	operators.&nbsp; For more advanced pilots, we can do a "payout tow" where we 
	pull the winch behind a truck and payout the tow line to the pilot.&nbsp; 
	With almost two miles of special line, we can get pilots nearly a mile off 
	the ground.&nbsp; A hang glider pilot who was recently towed up with our 
	equipment commented, <span class="italics">"This was the safest towing I have done in all my years of towing. ...and I started towing in January 1978."</span></p>
	<p>Towing is safer than having pilots launch off of a hill because the tow (and flight) can be stopped instantly if there are problems during the first 5-10 seconds of the flight when the pilot 
	is close to the ground.&nbsp; The first moments after launch is most commonly the time when new pilots may experience problems.</p>
	<h2>Steps of a typical tow</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Pre-flight</strong> -- The pilot prepares for the flight by first doing a safety check (<a href="../preflight.htm">pre-flight</a>) with the help of the instructor/tow operator.&nbsp; A special tow bridle is 
		connected to the pilot's harness which has a quick release handle that can disconnect the pilot from the towline at anytime.<br><br></li>
		<li><strong>Layout</strong> -- The pilot will lay out the glider behind him.&nbsp; Depending on the wind speed, he may face forward for a forward inflation (calm - light winds) or he may 
		face towards the rear for a reverse inflation (light winds or greater).&nbsp; Most new pilots are more comfortable doing forward inflations until they have practiced their kiting skills.<br>
		<br></li>
		<li><strong>Towline</strong> -- The pilot is hooked to the towline.&nbsp; Between the towline and tow bridle there is a weak-link of the proper size so that if there is some problem during 
		the tow, such as the towline suddenly jamming, it will break and disconnect the pilot from the tow.&nbsp; There is also a bright orange drogue parachute attached between the weak-link and the 
		tow line to aid in recovering the tow line after the tow.&nbsp; It also allows a tow assistant to easily spot the end of the tow line in order to bring it back to the launch area.&nbsp; The tow line stretches out about 1/4 mile in 
	front, then goes through a pulley mounted high on a truck, and then all the way back to the winch which is very close to where the pilot begins the tow.&nbsp; The tow operator has a special knife (hook knife) that he 
		can use at any time to instantly cut the towline, separating it from the winch, if there is some problem during the tow.<br><br></li>
		<li><strong>Launch preparation</strong> -- When the pilot is ready (and is doing a forward inflation), he will bow deeply to indicate that he is ready to launch.&nbsp; The tow operator will 
		<span class="italics">never</span> launch the pilot until he is certain that the <span class="italics">pilot is ready and wants to launch</span>.&nbsp; If the pilot is doing a reverse inflation, he will inflate (bring up) his 
		wing and, facing backwards, kite it for moment in order to check everything.&nbsp; When he is ready, he will turn forward.&nbsp; This tells the tow operator that the pilot is ready to launch.&nbsp; 
		Launching a paraglider requires the pilot to do many things at once -- about six in number.&nbsp; It is impossible to think about and perform each one at the same time -- which is why 
		extensive practice and training is necessary to safely fly a paraglider.<br><br></li>
		<li><span class="bold">Forward inflation launch</span> -- The pilot will face forward with the glider laying on the ground behind him.&nbsp; After bowing deeply (he is ready to fly), the tow 
		operator will slowly and precisely increase the pulling force on the towline.&nbsp; Typically, to make the launch quick and easy, the pilot will resist the tow force by leaning back against 
		the force of the towline.&nbsp; When the force becomes irresistible, the pilot will lunge forward and run with all his strength.&nbsp; The glider will popup overhead.&nbsp; At this time, the 
		pilot may need to apply brake on one side or the other to ensure that the glider is flying in the forward direction.&nbsp; If it is and all things looks good, the tow operator will continue the tow, gently 
		increasing the tow force as the pilot is running forward.&nbsp; If the winds are calm (most often), the pilot may run 10-20 yards during which time the lift on the glider will increase and the 
		pilot will feel it in the harness.&nbsp; As often as not, the new pilot will think,.&nbsp; If the winds are calm (most often), the pilot may run 10-20 yards during which time the lift on the glider will increase and the 
		pilot will feel it in the harness.&nbsp; As often as not, the new pilot will think, <span class="italics">"I'm flying! I'm flying! Wheee! I'm flying!" </span>-- and promptly sit down in the harness.&nbsp; But 
		there is not enough lift and he will be sitting on the ground, bouncing along for a second or two while the glider dives forward.&nbsp; The tow operator will stop the tow -- and we 
		must start over.&nbsp; Aborting the launch at this time is harmless.&nbsp; Depending on how the pilot feels, we may try things again, take a break, or quit for the day.&nbsp; 
		Thankfully, with forward inflations the glider almost launches itself, requiring minimal input from the pilot.<br><br></li>
		<li><span class="bold">Reverse inflation launch</span> -- Students capable of making a reverse inflation will begin the launch run after turning forward.&nbsp; This is the signal that they are 
		ready to fly.&nbsp; The tow operator will gradually increase the tow force as the pilot begins his launch run.&nbsp; Depending on the level of training desired and the conditions, the tow operator may have the 
		pilot run a long distance or short.&nbsp; Running a long distance might be typical of a launch from a shallow sloped site and it will require the pilot to both stay directly under the glider 
		and control its direction while he is on the ground.&nbsp; It is a great workout to run across the field and then very slowly leave the earth!<br><br></li>
		<li><strong>Tow force during launch</strong> -- Before the pilot's feet leave the ground, the tow force can be next to nothing (experienced pilots) or very strong (new pilots).&nbsp; However, the exact moment his feet leave 
		the ground, the tow operator must instantly back off on the tow forces to the point where the pilot is just climbing out (100'/min.)<br><br>Why is this?&nbsp; There are two serious hazards when 
		towing.&nbsp; One is known as <a href="../AvoidingLockout/avoidinglockout.htm">lockout</a> and the other is an uncontrolled surge of the glider when close to the ground which is typically 
		caused by a break of the weak-link.&nbsp; The latter hazard is what must be prevented during launch and why the tow force must be decreased when the pilot's feet leave the ground.&nbsp; If there is a 
		break in the weak-link, for example, the glider will be just a little bit behind the pilot as he rises but not far behind.&nbsp; If it is far behind and the line breaks, the glider will 
		quickly surge forward if not stopped by an application of the brakes.&nbsp; 
		In the next moment of an uncontrolled surge, the pilot will immediately begin to swing under the glider and forward.&nbsp; At altitude this would be a relatively benign event but when near the 
		ground the pilot could hit the ground while swinging forward with enough force to be fatal.&nbsp; Only after the pilot is high enough where a sudden release of the tow force would not result 
		in him swinging into the ground, is it safe to increase the tow forces enough so that the pilot climbs up quickly.&nbsp; In any case, tow force should never result in the glider being more 
		than about 40 degrees from the vertical behind the pilot.&nbsp; While stall is virtually impossible under tow because of the physics, a sudden release of the tow force is still frightening to 
		the pilot.&nbsp; Such an event can lead to panic and is something we take the greatest pains to avoid in interest of pilot safety.<br><br></li>
		<li><strong>During the tow </strong>-- Once the pilot has left the ground, he has only ONE job and that is to ensure that the glider and the tow line are perpendicular to each other.&nbsp; 
		This means that he must be looking up at the glider (the tips) and then down to the tow line while making adjustments with one brake or the other as needed.&nbsp; New pilots are so overwhelmed 
		that they usually are incapable of knowing what to do, even if thoroughly briefed beforehand.&nbsp; This is why new pilots are given two radios attached directly to the helmet right next to 
		the ears so that the tow operator/instructor can give them the correct commands to keep the glider and tow line perpendicular.<br><br></li>
		<li><strong>If the tow goes wrong</strong> -- What happens when the tow "goes wrong"?&nbsp; If the pilot, for whatever reason, cannot keep the glider and the tow line perpendicular the glider 
		will begin to enter lockout.&nbsp; <span class="italics">Uncontrolled lockout is exceedingly dangerous!</span>&nbsp; Referring to the boy with the kite, everyone knows what can happen to a kite.&nbsp; In the air, it may 
		turn sharply to the left or to the right and then, if the boy does nothing but continue to pull on it, it will quickly dive towards the ground and hit with tremendous speed.&nbsp; A 
		paraglider or hang glider will do the same, usually with fatal results to the attached pilot.&nbsp; At first, the glider gets a little off perpendicular with little change in attitude.&nbsp; 
		But as it continues to veer away from the direction of tow, the forces increase as the square of the difference in the angle off the perpendicular and both glider and pilot begin to head for the ground, like the 
		boy's kite.&nbsp; Thankfully, the remedy to lockout is simple, foolproof, and quick: immediately stop the tow!&nbsp; The moment the tow stops, the glider will immediately -- and safely -- 
		stabilize directly over the pilot's head, where it should be.&nbsp; This is the passive safety only present in paragliders.&nbsp; If a pilot does absolutely nothing, the wing will fly overhead 
		at trim in a straight line through the air.&nbsp; Tow operators must be thoroughly trained and certified to know exactly what to do in an emergency.&nbsp; What if the pilot does a sudden 180 
		degree turn while under tow?&nbsp; The glider will enter lockout very quickly -- so quickly that the tow operator may have to cut the line.<br><br>Typically, new pilots who are towing for the 
		first few times have difficulty keeping things lined up and, as a result, I (the tow operator) will have to stop the tow and wait for the pilot to fly "straight" (the direction of tow).&nbsp; If it 
		does not happen, I will instruct the pilot to release from tow, if he is able to respond in that way, and then land somewhere.&nbsp; At the sod farms, we have hundreds of clear acres for pilots to 
		land.&nbsp; Most new pilots require two or three tows to learn how to fly their gliders correctly while being towed.<br><br></li>
		<li><strong>End of tow</strong> -- The end of tow can be any time the pilot desires.&nbsp; There can be many reasons why a pilot wants to get off tow.&nbsp; He may feel airsick or encountered 
		rough air.&nbsp; Sometimes he may be so nervous that he wants to end the flight ASAP.&nbsp; Experienced pilots may sense a thermal and need to get off tow so they can grab it and fly 
		up and away.&nbsp; It does not matter the reason because there is no time when a pilot cannot safely LET GO of the brakes and pull the release lever.&nbsp; Ordinarily, we desire the pilot to 
		release at the <span class="italics">highest</span> part of the tow.&nbsp; This is usually when the pilot approaches the "turn around pulley" that is attached to a high mast fitted on one of 
		the trucks.&nbsp; If he flies past this point, he will begin descending and I will have to release the tow by letting the tow line drum free-wheel or by cutting the line.<br><br>a.) As the 
		pilot approaches the point where he wants to release from tow, I ask that he performs a big "scissors kick" with his legs so I know he is about to release.&nbsp; I then back off on the tow 
		force to lessen the surge of the glider after it is released from tow.<br>b.) LET GO of the brakes.&nbsp; 
		You cannot pull the release handle AND hold the brakes at the same.&nbsp; To do so may cause the glider to stall (another extremely dangerous event) because he will have to bring the brake 
		toggles why down and past the karabiners.&nbsp; <br>c.)&nbsp; LOOK for the release handle and grab it.&nbsp; Use the OTHER hand to grab the tow bridle strap that does NOT have the release handle.&nbsp; 
		<br>d.)&nbsp; PULL the release handle.&nbsp; The drogue parachute and tow line will drop away.&nbsp; <br>e.) With BOTH hands, separate the tow bridle straps.&nbsp; Why do this?&nbsp; Rarely, the 
		release line will form a friction knot that might prevent the tow line from disconnecting from the bridle.&nbsp; Sometimes pilots can get confused and yank on the straps rather than pull the 
		release handle.&nbsp; They then might have to reach down and unclip the karabiner that connects them to the tow line.&nbsp; There is no danger because I know they are having trouble and have 
		stopped the tow or, in extreme situations, have cut the tow line.&nbsp; In case things jam at the turn around pulley or at the winch, the weak link will break long before the tow line can 
		cause dangerous lockout.<br><br></li>
		<li><strong>Flying away</strong> -- AFTER the tow, the pilot will use his hands to get comfortable in the harness and THEN reach up and grasp the brakes.&nbsp; It is then we will do maneuvers.<br><br>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Getting ready to land</strong> -- The first thing a pilot MUST do before landing is to stand up in the harness when he is about 100' above the ground.&nbsp; He is not quite 
		vertical but his feet are down and ready.&nbsp; When he is a few feet or less above the ground (depending on the type of glider), he may bring his hands down 7"-10" to start slowing the glider 
		down.&nbsp; Right before his feet touch the ground he must pull the brakes all the way down as far as he can.&nbsp; This will flare/stall the glider and it will stop moving forward and, 
		depending on the glider type, it may "jump" making the landing a softer one.&nbsp; Once he lands, it is important for him to keep his hands down.&nbsp; He may then turn, face the glider, and 
		gather it up (rosette it).&nbsp; He may also release all brake by raising his hands the moment his feet touch the ground and kite the glider for as long as he wants.&nbsp; More detail on how 
		to land safely and comfortably can be found on <a href="../Landing/landingproperly.htm">this page</a>.<br><br></li>
		<li><strong>After landing</strong> -- At this time, the pilot should quickly rosette his glider because winds in the LZ can suddenly re-inflate the glider, pull the pilot over, and drag him.&nbsp; This 
		is not a worry at the sod farms but at your typical LZ, it might matter!</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Additional notes</h2>
	<p>All new pilots 
	(including those having discovery flights) should review
	<a href="../DixonWhite/dixonwhitetowing.htm">Dixon White's notes 
	on towing</a> before being towed.&nbsp; The course fees include instruction on 
	how to be towed safely.&nbsp; Paraglider pilots will receive the "surface tow" special skills 
	USHPA certification upon completion of the P2 or higher course.&nbsp; 
	Powered Paragliding certifications do not have a specials skills 
	certification for towing.</p>
	<p>Below, a student pilot demonstrates perfect form at launch from tow.&nbsp; 
	Note the position of his hands  –  they are even in height and close to the pulleys (full up position).&nbsp; He is still 
	pushing on the "A" lines (but just barely now) to give the wing the speed it 
	needs to get overhead.&nbsp; In a second, he will release the "A" lines and 
	have only the brakes in his hands.&nbsp; He continues to run.&nbsp; In 4-5 
	seconds he will leave the ground!&nbsp; The orange object is a drogue 
	parachute which helps recover the tow line after the pilot disconnects.&nbsp; 
	The white line across the photo is the other end of the tow line that comes 
	from the "turn around" pulley a quarter of a mile away.&nbsp; Paragliding is 
	easier in the beginning stages because the glider  –  basically  –  flies 
	itself. </p>

	<p>Here is a <a href="../HGPGAssocCanadaTowingInfo.pdf">complete explanation</a> of how towing works (Courtesy of the Hang 
	Gliding/Paragliding Association of Canada).</p>
	<p>A major disadvantage of towing is the expense and only one pilot can be in the air at a time.&nbsp; However, the safety and convenience of towing makes up for this.</p>
	<h2>Launch events with PPG</h2>
	<p>Events such as timing the throttle on the paramotor, 
	inflating the wing, staying under it, preventing the glider from diving to 
	one side or the other, and enduring the noise of a fully powered engine can 
	be a bit much for the beginning pilot.</p>
	<h3>How do we fix this issue?</h3>
	<p>With our special training technique we add new events one at a time when 
	the pilot is ready rather than overwhelm him with a host of new tasks at the 
	same time. We begin with a simple launch and landing  –  all under tow, in a 
	straight line, and with no paramotor (or, in the case of wheeled PPG, the 
	engine will not be running).&nbsp; Then, step by step, we increase the 
	necessary tasks required.&nbsp; This method of instruction increases pilot 
	safety and helps prevent damage to the equipment.&nbsp; Training for wheeled 
	powered paragliding is slightly different  –  contact us if you have any 
	questions.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Training at a hill still has advantages, such as being more like what a pilot actually does at a mountain site.</p>
