	<h1>Paraglider FAQs</h1>
		<p><strong>Type of aircraft</strong> Soaring  –  a paraglider wing has a 
		true airfoil shape and flies just like any other aircraft. It has little 
		in common with a parachute although it superficially looks like one. Go 
		here for <a href="../ParagliderPhysics/pgphysics.htm">detailed info</a> on how a paraglider works.&nbsp; Go here 
		to learn more about how <a href="../PGRating.pdf">paragliders are rated</a> (it is generally&nbsp; 
		based on their ability to spontaneously recover from collapses).</p>
	<p><strong>Types of paragliders</strong>&nbsp; non-powered, foot launched paragliding (PG)&nbsp; 
	foot launched powered paragliding (PPG)&nbsp; trike or quad powered 
	paragliding</p>
	<p><strong>Total weight of PG aircraft and common accessories</strong> 20-55 lbs.&nbsp; For 
	PPG, this can range from 45-220 lbs. </p>
	<p><strong>Speed in flight</strong> 15-45+ mph</p>
	<p><strong>Control method</strong> Weight shift, changing the positions of the glider's 
	trailing edge or wingtips, and (less often) changing the position of the 
	leading edge</p>
	<p><strong>Maximum altitude</strong> 18,000' (set by FAA regulations)</p>
	<p><strong>Cruising Range</strong> Depends on the pilot and conditions  –  can be a few 
	hundred yards or a 100 miles.&nbsp; On a recent trip to Florida, local PG 
	pilot Lee Boone went over 65 miles cross country in lift solely from 
	thermals.&nbsp; For PPG, the range can be 2-5 hours of air time, depending 
	on the amount of fuel carried.&nbsp; Skilled PPG pilots can fly hundreds of 
	miles by combining power with thermalling and/or ridge lift.</p>
	<p><strong>Rate of sink through calm air</strong> 200+ ft./minute</p>
	<p><strong>Glide Ratio</strong> 1 foot of drop to 6-12 feet of forward travel</p>
	<p><strong>Turning radius</strong> Less than 30 yd.&nbsp; For trikes/quads, the radius 
	increases to about 150'.</p>
	<p><strong>Method used to stay in the air for long periods</strong>&nbsp; Finding air going 
	up (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal">thermals</a>,
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_lift">ridge lift</a>, and/or
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_waves">standing waves</a> in the 
	air).&nbsp; PPG pilots use the power of the paramotor to stay in the air.&nbsp; 
	They can also find air going up, as well, but this is rare as most PPG 
	pilots do not like turbulence of any kind.</p>
	<p><strong>Safety</strong> Statistically similar to motorcycle riding (safety is largely a 
	factor of pilot's skill and not flying beyond it).&nbsp; Properly trained&nbsp; 
	pilots who are diligent to adhere to well established rules for flight 
	preparation, who thoroughly understand the weather and how it affects 
	safety, and who avoid extreme or dangerous maneuvers can expect years of 
	safe flying.&nbsp; Nonetheless, paragliding  –  like all forms of sport 
	aviation  –  is inherently dangerous, often forgiving of mistakes, but not 
	nearly often enough.</p>
	<p><strong>Most common injury</strong> Ankle sprain.&nbsp; For PPG, the most common injury 
	is being struck by the propeller while starting the engine.</p>
	<p><strong>Reason for injuries</strong> Pilot error 99.99% of the time.&nbsp; The most 
	common error is pilots flying in conditions above their skill level.&nbsp; 
	The second most common error is pilots flying gliders rated above their 
	skill level.&nbsp; Pilots who are good kiters of their wing while on the 
	ground will be skilled in the air.&nbsp; Unfortunately, many pilots are 
	injured due to disorientation and/or panic because they were flying in 
	conditions above their skill level or doing things they should not have been 
	doing (e.g., acrobatics or maneuvers near the ground).&nbsp; Thorough 
	training is the most important factor in avoiding unnecessary risk in our 
	sport.&nbsp; Most accidents happen at launch.</p>
	<p><strong>Average cost of a complete PG setup</strong> $6,000+&nbsp;&nbsp; PPG setup: 
	$10,000+.&nbsp; This does not include training.</p>

	<p><strong>Launching-Landing</strong>&nbsp; Launching PG may be done from a hill or mountain 
	site where we (hopefully) find air that is going up faster than the 
	paraglider sinks through the air.&nbsp; We can also be towed up from flat 
	ground by means of a long line paid out behind a vehicle or pulled in by a 
	winch.&nbsp; Go
	here for a 
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYCq1lFvkXc&amp;feature=player_embedded">typical launch sequence</a> of a paraglider by a new student 
	pilot.&nbsp; We never "jump off a cliff"!&nbsp; Instead, we lay out our wing 
	in front of us (our back to where we are flying) and then bring the wing up 
	over our head.&nbsp; When everything looks good, we turn, and step away like 
	in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0aMu_oSKPc">this video</a> or
	in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyWHpajOHv0">this one</a>.&nbsp; 
	Launching PPG is usually done from a flat area in the same manner as any 
	powered aircraft:&nbsp; Heading is into the wind and then we apply the 
	throttle.&nbsp; It is a little more complicated than this but not much.&nbsp; 
	A launch may take from 1' to 100' or more before we are in the air depending 
	on the wind speed and slope at launch.</p>
	<p><strong>Rescue System</strong>&nbsp; Usually an ordinary round parachute stowed below the 
	seat. Go here for more info on <a href="../Reserves/reserves.htm">reserve rescue systems</a>.&nbsp; Most PPG setups do not include a rescue system because most 
	PPG pilots fly in calm/dead air.</p>

	<p><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
	<p>Because it has the slowest speed of any aircraft, a paraglider can do 
	things no other can do, including helicopters.&nbsp; This includes soaring 
	small mesas, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maars">maars</a>, sand 
	dunes, landing almost anywhere, and flying within a few yards of mountainous 
	sites shared only with the soaring birds – our frequent companions in the 
	air.&nbsp; Trike/quad PPG has more limited options for launching and 
	landing.</p>
	<p>Pilots who learn PG first will always be better PPG pilots as they have a 
	more intimate knowledge of the glider and the air in which we fly.&nbsp; 
	Flying in thermals is normal for PG so the PG trained PPG pilot has much 
	more confidence and skill to fly in many different conditions.&nbsp; The 
	most important requirement is that a pilot complete his training and 
	maintain focus on the sport  –  something very necessary for long term flying 
	safety.</p>
	<p>PPG pilots can climb out and go anywhere, no matter whether the air is 
	going up or not.&nbsp; One of the special features of PPG is that a pilot 
	can go for miles just a few feet off the ground  –  it is the magic of slow 
	flight close to the earth and the content of many dreams.</p>
	<p>The wing is controlled almost the same way as other aircraft  –  we pull 
	on various lines that are connected to the wing and can make it do the same 
	things as an ordinary airplane wing.&nbsp; Slowly moving through the air 
	allows us to get closer to the landscape than any other aircraft.&nbsp; 
	Non-powered paragliding is unequaled to other types of flying as it is so 
	peaceful.</p>
	<p>PG is the least expensive overall but requires the most skill.&nbsp; It 
	has the highest return on a pilot's investment in training and is the most 
	like being a soaring bird.&nbsp; It requires no fossil fuel to launch and 
	fly for hours at a time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ridge and thermal soaring is the domain of the PG 
	pilot where the pilot effectively uses his knowledge of meteorology, 
	topography, aerodynamics, and experience.&nbsp; When in the air, only a 
	modest rush of the wind is heard.&nbsp; PG and hang gliding pilots connect 
	with the air in a way no other aircraft can.</p>

	<p>
We can gain thousands of feet in altitude in the smallest of thermals 
	because we can do complete turns in less than 30 yards.&nbsp; Our slow speed 
	minimizes wind noise so we can hear sounds on the ground and in the air  –  
	we are a peaceful and quiet aircraft.&nbsp; Also, we are not encumbered by 
	cockpits and glass so it’s a 360 degree view in all directions.</p>
	<p>FL PPG is not as nimble and agile as PG but has the advantage of 
	launching from the flatlands, in no-wind conditions, and flying at times of 
	the day when conditions are completely calm.&nbsp; A significant 
	disadvantage is that the pilot has to carry 45 - 70 lbs. of machinery on his 
	back.&nbsp; It is an ideal form of paragliding in coastal regions or near 
	large bodies of water where on-shore winds are gentle and reliable much of 
	the time and the soft sand of a beach is the landing zone.&nbsp; In desert 
	climates (and at high altitudes as here in the southwest) launching is 
	generally pretty easy but landing can require a fast (but quick) run if the 
	wind dies.&nbsp; Only the physically fit should consider FL PPG.&nbsp; All 
	of your joints and back should be in tip-top condition.&nbsp; Below is a 
	photo of a typical FL PPG  –  the Miniplane.&nbsp; It only weighs about 44 
	lbs.</p>
	<p>

	<p>Trike PPG is the answer for powered flight without stress on your joints 
	or back or if you are overweight.&nbsp; This form of PPG is the easiest to 
	learn.&nbsp; Although it costs more than the other forms of paragliding, it 
	combines the advantages of all of them.&nbsp; Experienced pilots can fly 
	much of the same geography as PG or FL PG.&nbsp; A disadvantage is that it 
	requires greater time to make turns and inputs to the wing are not as fast.&nbsp; 
	Ridge and thermal soaring should not be done.&nbsp; Landing mishaps are 
	rarely more than a bent bolt in the wheel axle or a broken prop.&nbsp; Touch 
	and go flying is an easy task with the Trike PPG.&nbsp;Trike PPG pilots should 
	always be close to a runway of some kind.&nbsp; It is not the right kind of 
	aircraft to venture out to unknown places as it can only land or take-off 
	where the ground is flat, smooth, and level.</p>
