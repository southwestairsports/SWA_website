	<h1>Towing Info by Dixon White</h1>
		<p>From the DVD “Paraglider Towing” with Dixon White  –  Additional notes 
		by Had Robinson</p>
	<h2>Pilot</h2>
	<p>Pre-Flight – Pilot must take responsibility for his own pre-flight check. 
	&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Hook Knife – Not required if you are a new student pilot. &nbsp;</p>
	<p>Release Practice – Pilot must practice releasing from the tow bridle on 
	the ground. &nbsp;</p>
	<p>Release Cord Access – Release must be in easy reach of the pilot while in 
	flight. &nbsp;</p>
	<p>Radio Skills – Radio communications must be effective between tow crew 
	and pilot. &nbsp;</p>
	<p>Release Signal – Pilot indicates he wants to be released by doing a 
	sidewise double scissor kick with his legs.&nbsp; Pilot must NOT release 
	from the tow until he feels the tow pressure go slack unless he is 100’ AGL 
	or more. (A premature release under full tow pressure could cause a potentially dangerous surge of the pilot’s glider.&nbsp; – Had)</p>
	<p>Glider Flying Angle – Pilot must ALWAYS keep the glider perpendicular to 
	the part of the tow line that is directly in front of him. </p>
	<p>The tow line can be curved up to 90 degrees or more a long distance from 
	the pilot. Pilot must scan constantly from the tow line in front to the wing 
	above and back.&nbsp; It is easier to check the wing tips than the center of the wing.&nbsp; To check it about every 5 seconds would be sufficient. 
	Lockout can easily happen if the glider gets off the perpendicular to the 
	tow line.&nbsp; The forces increase exponentially as the angle increases.&nbsp; 
	It is extremely dangerous not to correct the glider's direction when needed. 
	&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Lockout – The moment the pilot senses he is in lockout, he should release 
	immediately.&nbsp; If he is unable to release, then he MUST use his hook 
	knife to cut the tow line/bridle (only for experienced pilots doing special 
	maneuvers during tow).&nbsp; If the tow operator observes the beginning of 
	lockout, he will release the tow and, possibly, cut the tow line. &nbsp;</p>
	<p>Thermals – Pilot can release early if he feels that he is in a thermal in 
	which he can climb out with (P2 pilots or greater ONLY) &nbsp;</p>
	<p>Surge Control – When pilot releases from the tow bridle, he must be ready 
	to exercise some surge control, especially if there is substantial tow 
	pressure. &nbsp;</p>
	<p>Flight Gear – mandatory </p>
	<p>Equipment: Helmet, Ankle protective footwear, Reserve parachute (non-student pilots 
	only), Flotation device if flying over water, Unzip airbag in harness before 
	towing (if it has one) when flying over water &nbsp;</p>
	<p>During Tow – Pilot must stay off the brakes except to steer. </p>
	<p>Glider will have plenty of energy in case of some event, like a strong 
	thermal coming through. Makes the tow easier and the pilot will climb 
	higher. &nbsp;</p>
	<p>Water emergency landing:</p>
	<blockquote>Pilot should undo all straps holding him to the harness before landing in 
	the water. Get the hook knife in your hand so you can use it if needed! When 
	his toes start to drag through the water, he should slip out of the harness 
	and fall in the water. Let the glider fly past and overhead. Do not try to 
	rescue any gear!&nbsp; Pilots have drowned rescuing gear.&nbsp; (Note: Is there not time to do any preparation for a water landing, the moment you hit the water hold your breath, face down, and 
	then try to unbuckle your flight deck and THEN your harness.&nbsp; Your harness, if unbuckled, will force your head down.&nbsp; Hope that the water is still and that the rescue boat is near by. I 
	almost drowned once because of an incompetent tow operator. - Had)</blockquote>
	<h2>Tow Operator</h2>
	<p>Release tow on Signal – Instruct pilot that he is NOT to release the tow 
	unless there is an emergency.&nbsp; The pilot must signal the tow operator 
	if he wants to be released.&nbsp; If the tow operator needs to release the 
	pilot, he will release most of the tow pressure. – Had R. &nbsp;</p>
	<p>Glider Angle – He must always be sure the pilot’s glider is perpendicular 
	to the tow line – this is his job! &nbsp;</p>
	<p>Stop Tow Signal – Tow Operator needs to let pilot know when he is going 
	to stop the tow so that the pilot can release.&nbsp; (Note: The pilot should let the tow operator know when he is going to release, not the reverse. - Had) &nbsp;</p>
	<p>Tow Angle – Tow Operator wants to pull the pilot up at about a 45 degree 
	angle.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
	<p>Clear Tow Area – Make sure tow area is clear and safe from obstacles and 
	traffic. &nbsp;</p>
	<p>Emergency Preparedness – Make sure you have "911 ready" cell phones in case 
	of an accident. &nbsp;</p>
	<p>Practice Tow – A practice tow using a couple of instructors can be 
	useful.&nbsp; (This should always be done. - Had) &nbsp;</p>
	<p>Weak Link Spec – For the weak link use 205 leech-line.&nbsp; A loop of 
	line around two quick links with a single overhand knot breaks at about 90 
	lbs.&nbsp; A single line with a knot breaks around 60 lbs. &nbsp;</p>
	<p>Cross Wind – Don’t tow if the air is more than 25 degrees cross to the 
	tow direction (for new pilots only).</p>
