	<h1>How to spot thermal sources and triggers in the flatlands from XC 
	Magazine</h1>
		<p>Few flying areas are really flat – there are always gentle contours. 
		There may be gentle hills and ridges but we have to assume that none 
		will be dynamically soarable in the flats. I will always try to avoid 
		reaching any ridge at a height that would put me low on its windward 
		face. It’s most likely that the thermal will be triggering off its peak 
		or lee side so you must be able to over-fly it on your last ditch 
		attempt to get up. It’s very common for inexperienced XC pilots to try 
		and ridge soar a slope, whilst simply flying past it would have worked 
		far better.</p>
	<p>In a completely flat landscape with no lee side protection from the wind 
	then even a crop of tall, dry wheat can give good enough protection from the 
	wind to allow higher temperatures to be reached amongst the stalks. Early in 
	the day this can be more effective than a dark, ploughed field. However, 
	later in the day naked earth or rock will maintain a higher surface 
	temperature allowing quick heating of the air above it and possible provide 
	a near constant column thermal. The field of wheat, having once released its 
	thermal, will take longer to re-heat and re-release.</p>
	<p>Apart from the usual physical triggers like irregularities in the 
	landscape, small hills, tree lines, conurbations, buildings and bodies of 
	water, you’ll also find certain airflows trigger thermals too. A small hill 
	can split the wind and when it converges again behind it it may draw air 
	from your source. Cold air will undercut and release warm air at the source 
	too – for example air blowing off water or coming from a shaded area – so 
	it’s a good idea to fly the shadow line of a cloud as you fly down wind. </p>
	<p>Sometimes you can get a source and trigger combination to fly along. In 
	very dry flatland environments like Manilla and central Spain river courses 
	work well. They are slightly lower than the surrounding land, allowing some 
	protection from the wind for better heating and the surrounding air will 
	have a slightly greater relative humidity. Vegetation along the banks gives 
	contrast and protection from the cooling wind and trees lining the banks act 
	as useful triggers.</p>
	<p>See you in the air!</p>
