	<h1>The Real Meaning of FAR 103</h1>
		<p><span class="italics">Some helpful info about our aircraft (FAR part 
		103 – ultralights) and how to stay out of trouble and out of the way.&nbsp; 
		It was written by Cpt. Jack Brown (AK, CFI, AAW &amp; competition PG pilot) 
		and sent to me by Zak Hargraves.&nbsp; – Had</span></p>
	<p>Any pilot operating a large or high speed military aircraft has the 
	identical responsibility to see and avoid us (PG pilots) and our flying 
	area, as we do to stay out of his MOA (military operations area).<br><br>
	Notice that my focus was on "see and avoid" not where we are on the pecking 
	order.&nbsp; I don't care if you are the flying a 747-400, an F22, or a 
	Super Cub.&nbsp; Every pilot has an equal responsibility to see and avoid 
	and yield if necessary in the interest of safety to any other aircraft, of 
	any category, operating under any set of FARs (Federal Aviation 
	Regulations). This rule has been in place for the 30+ years I've been flying 
	and was tested at our Girdwood site when some hotshot GA pilot came in to 
	land a few years ago and had to maneuver around paragliders to make a normal 
	approach and landing.&nbsp; He went screaming bloody hell to the FAA and 
	they calmly advised him that he had no more legal right to the airspace in 
	and around the Girdwood traffic pattern than the paragliders did...end of 
	issue. <br><br>The goal of every paraglider and part 103 pilot (paraglider 
	pilots) should clearly be to yield at all times as is clear in the 
	regulations. However, this doesn't give any aircraft, civilian or military 
	the right to run us down or try and exercise priority rights to any airspace 
	that we are both entitled to fly in. This also means that we, as free flight 
	part 103 pilots, have every right to the use of any airspace which is safe 
	and legal for us to use, without carrying the baggage of "Gee, I'm a lowly 
	part 103 pilot, maybe I shouldn't be here" If a pattern of conflict can be 
	tied to an issue of safety at a particular uncontrolled airport over a 
	period of time then there is a system in place within the FAA to address 
	this.<br><br>It is quite clear about this; we are REQUIRED to YIELD to all 
	aircraft. We can ask that military pilots be aware of our flying area and 
	avoid it, but while in the air it's our responsibility to yield to aircraft. 
	Yes, I realize it's hard to do that when you're going 20mph and the jet is 
	doing 250+. That's still the way the law reads, practical or not.<br><br>15 
	years ago the FAA tried to violate me, the photo of a 737 for nearly running 
	down an LAB Cherokee 6 near Juneau. I was on an IFR flight plan, was 
	tracking out on the Juneau localizer at about 8000 feet, and was exactly 
	where I was supposed to be. The LAB pilot was just motoring along on a 
	beautiful blue day outbound in front of me dead center also on the localizer 
	because he wasn't paying attention. He clearly was in the wrong and was 
	basically smack dab in the middle of my exclusive highway in the sky.&nbsp; 
	He was VFR and had no business being where he was, even though he was 
	technically ok.</p>
	<p>The Feds were determined to violate me for failing to 
	"See and Avoid" this other aircraft because it was rather traumatic for the 
	LAB pilot and his passengers. My jaw about hit the floor when I found out 
	they were attempting to violate me. When they finally determined that he was 
	on my departure path (the localizer), they terminated their violation effort 
	and I was eventually commended for being alert enough to actually see him in 
	time to avoid a midair. So in the bigger scheme of things, he is required to 
	'yield' to me the 737, just as a paraglider is required to 'yield' to other 
	aircraft.<br><br>My point being that if an F16 decides to make an approved 
	flight through our primary ER (extended range) flying site and hits a part 
	103 paraglider, the F16 pilot is just as legally responsible for the 
	accident as the paraglider is.... <span class="italics">(Note by Had: Think about this: Who will 
	survive the collision and who will not?)</span>&nbsp; There is no difference in 
	pilot responsibility. Same would hold true for a single engine Cessna or any 
	other aircraft. The legal responsibility to "see and avoid" should not be 
	confused with FARs defining the part 103 pilot's pecking order in terms of 
	who's yielding to who.&nbsp; If I decided to end a short ER XC (cross 
	country) flight at the Birchwood Airport, then I'd need to yield to the 
	150's doing touch and goes, or any other GA (general aviation) aircraft 
	which are in the traffic pattern.&nbsp; If I'm high over Moose Meadow and 
	decide to land at the airport, then I need to be certain that I yield to any 
	fixed wing or rotor wing aircraft who might also be in the pattern. When we 
	talk about our pecking order, this is what the regs are referring to.&nbsp; 
	Aircraft separation away from the airport is accomplished by every pilot 
	regardless of their part 103 ranking. This is the legal responsibility of 
	every pilot and has nothing to do with yielding to one another.<br><br>One 
	thing that might help is to get some face-to-face time with the local 
	military controllers and command structure, and see if maybe&nbsp; you can 
	get them out to the flying site for an introduction.<br><br>I agree this is 
	an excellent idea. I think if they saw first hand our 'operation' in ER 
	(aircraft), it would become quite clear why it is so important that they 
	limit any and all military operations within that specific area for pure 
	safety reasons.</p>
