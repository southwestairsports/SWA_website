	<h1>High Wind Launches</h1>
		<p>By Had Robinson</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Please reference the video
		<a href="http://youtu.be/fAqzn9KG23k">here</a>.&nbsp; The actual launch 
		is in 1/4 speed.&nbsp; What follows in the video is a 
		rowdy but fun flight in the high winds of that day.&nbsp; The landing 
		was also turbulent but there were no hazards about.<br><br>The secret to 
		a successful high wind launch is, first of all, being an expert kiter.&nbsp; 
		A pilot cannot expect to maintain control without this skill.&nbsp; He 
		must know precisely how his glider handles.<br><br>The hardest thing to 
		learn in a high wind launch is what is just the right amount of "A" input 
		to get the wing overhead quickly.&nbsp; Too much A and the glider will 
		do a frontal.&nbsp; Too little A and the pilot will likely get dragged 
		out of control.&nbsp; When the glider gets nearly overhead, the brakes 
		must be applied just enough to keep the glider from going too far in 
		front and collapsing.&nbsp; The pilot in
		<a href="http://youtu.be/WAf1LKF5GeQ">this video</a> at one of our local sites did exactly the wrong thing while launching in high winds.<br><br>Pilots should not attempt to launch when winds 
		are more than 18 mph at launch because winds just above launch will be 
		higher and the pilot will likely go backwards right after launching.&nbsp; 
		Applying speed bar close to the terrain where there is more turbulence 
		is also dangerous.&nbsp; I applied a slight bit of speed bar after I 
		shot up from launch and was out in front.&nbsp; The higher I went, the 
		greater the wind speed was and I had to apply a little more speed bar.&nbsp; 
		Was it safe to apply some speed bar a few hundred feet away from launch?&nbsp; 
		Probably…but a pilot can never be too careful.<br><br>There are some 
		other ways to inflate a glider in high winds but this way is the most 
		reliable and safe.&nbsp; Furthermore, the launch can be aborted without 
		going out of control.<br><br>WARNING: DO NOT CONNECT THE GLIDER TO YOUR 
		HARNESS UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO LAUNCH!</p>
	<h2>Preparation for the Rosette Launch</h2>
	<p>Hopefully, you will have some help but this maneuver can be done alone.&nbsp; 
	Careful and detailed preparation is essential for safety.&nbsp; If you do 
	have help, have the other person stand right behind the glider ready to grab 
	it if things start to go out of control.&nbsp; Most people have no idea of 
	the correct way to assist a pilot who is about to be dragged so you will 
	have to clearly instruct them.<br><br>Where it is not as windy, form the 
	glider into a rosette (see photo in video).&nbsp; It has to be done 
	perfectly with the leading edge clearly visible all around.&nbsp; The shape 
	must be like a "C".<br><br>Take the glider to launch and then carefully 
	arrange the lines in an “S” or "snake" pattern on top of the rosetted glider 
	so that when the lines are pulled out they will not tangle, much like how a 
	parachute would deploy.&nbsp; A tangle, a twig, or a cravat could cause the 
	pilot to go off to one side of the launch area out of control.&nbsp; Lay the 
	risers in such a way that you know how to connect them to the harness 
	without stretching out the lines.&nbsp; In case a sudden gust rolls in and 
	starts to inflate the glider, a pilot can immediately stop it by falling on 
	the glider and grabbing it.&nbsp; If he clips in with the lines stretched 
	out and then has an accidental inflation, things are a lot harder to keep 
	under control.<br><br>The advantage of the rosette is that high winds will 
	not as easily inflate it before the pilot is ready.&nbsp; Also, the tips 
	will not come up with the center of the wing which helps ensure that the 
	glider comes up square.&nbsp; A fully laid out glider is almost impossible 
	to control in high winds nor can it be inflated in a safe manner 
	consistently.</p>
	<h2>Launch</h2>
	<p>It is very important to never back away from the rosetted glider until 
	you are completely ready to launch.<br><br>Standing right in front of the 
	glider, clip in. Do your preflight check at this time.&nbsp; With the brakes 
	in the hands, get the A’s in one hand and the D’s in the other.&nbsp; This 
	is known as “variation #3” in the Pilot’s Training Manual from Wills Wing.&nbsp; 
	If you are not absolutely confident in using this method to handle the 
	glider, do not attempt a high wind launch.<br><br>At this point, you are 
	ready to begin the launch sequence.<br><br>Slowly and carefully, step 
	backwards into the wind while watching the rosetted glider for the slightest 
	twitch that might cause it to inflate prematurely. You must also watch the 
	lines as they pull out to be sure they are not tangled or compromised in 
	some way, like with a twig.&nbsp; If anything is amiss, quickly run back to 
	the rosetted glider and start over. <br><br>When the lines are just taunt, 
	the pilot is ready to bring the glider up.&nbsp; If he rosetted the glider 
	perfectly, the center will inflate first and rise as he pulls the right 
	amount of "A".&nbsp; He has to be extremely alert to any deformity in the 
	inflation and be able to quickly abort the launch by pulling the D’s and 
	making a dash to a tip of the glider and grabbing it.<br><br>As the glider 
	rises, there will not be enough time to brake one side or the other (in 
	order to steer it) so he must decide in a moment if it is coming up square.&nbsp; 
	If all is well and the glider is almost overhead, he can release the risers.&nbsp; 
	Now, he must apply a slight amount of brake to keep the glider from going 
	too far. Too much brake on one side or the other can cause a spin. <br><br>
	This is the most difficult part of launching in high winds.<br><br>The pilot 
	is now committed to launch.&nbsp; He will probably be yanked off the ground, 
	experience some serious pitching, and start to spin around to the forward 
	position.&nbsp; If the glider is properly inflated, this is not an issue  –  
	it will fly safely away.&nbsp; The pilot in the blown launch video did not 
	understand any of this and buried his brakes.<br>
	<br>It might be possible to stop things at this point by grabbing the A's 
	and pulling them down hard if he is not too far from the ground.&nbsp; 
	Things are happening so fast that there may not be time to find the A's and 
	grab them  –  the pilot will be too far from the ground.&nbsp; If he does the 
	maneuver successfully, he will have just a moment to grab the glider to keep 
	it from re-inflating.&nbsp; On the other hand, applying a lot of brake at 
	this moment in order to “stop things” would do just the opposite and create 
	a dangerous situation. <br><br>As the video shows, I am already off the 
	ground before I had time to turn and face forward. At this moment, the 
	tendency is to apply brake.&nbsp; THIS MUST BE RESISTED SO THAT THE GLIDER 
	CAN FLY STRAIGHT AHEAD AT FULL TRIM.&nbsp; A pilot's only concern at this 
	point is, "Is the glider safely overhead and flying?"</p>
	<h2>LET ‘ER FLY!</h2>
	<p>As the pilot goes up and forward, there will be pitch, roll, and yaw.&nbsp; 
	It is of minor concern because the wing is flying at trim and that is all 
	that matters.&nbsp; Once he is off the ground and well in front of launch, 
	he can get comfortable in the harness using a foot stirrup.&nbsp; It is just 
	plain dumb to fiddle around in any way while close to the terrain whatever 
	type of launch it is.&nbsp; A sudden collapse, although rare, can become a 
	disaster if the pilot is not 100% focused on flying the glider while he is 
	near the terrain.<br><br>Continue to fly straight out from launch – and 
	enjoy a great flight as I did in the video!</p>
