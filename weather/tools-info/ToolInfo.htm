	<p>Your safety and flying enjoyment 
	will greatly improve.&nbsp; Our thanks to Lance Tripoli, Tom Bird, and other 
	meteorologists of the of the National Weather Service for their help with 
	the weather.&nbsp; If you have questions about any of these tools, please 
	contact us.&nbsp; "*" = our most important tools</p>
	<h2>Weather Tools</h2>
	<p>*<a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?site=epz&amp;map.x=218&amp;map.y=163">El 
	Paso National Weather Service</a>&nbsp;The wind speeds and directions are for El 
	Paso International&nbsp; Airport.&nbsp; They are often different than where 
	we fly on the west side.&nbsp; You should always check the NWS forecast 
	before flying.&nbsp; It is always helpful to read the forecast discussion 
	section.&nbsp; What aspect of weather is not important for all soaring 
	pilots?</p>
	<p>*<a href="http://mesowest.utah.edu/cgi-bin/droman/mesomap.cgi?state=NM&amp;address=&amp;type=&amp;noho=&amp;rawsflag=3">Meso 
	West Region</a> – This is one of our most helpful sites in seeing what may 
	be ahead in the short term and reports the weather conditions of dozens of 
	stations in our area.&nbsp; To see the trend over 24 hours, click on 
	the desired weather station and then the "wind" tab to see how the speed and 
	gusts are trending.&nbsp; Click on the "Vector Wind" tab to see the trend in 
	wind direction.&nbsp; Station Santa Teresa NWS R (our local NWS station) 
	feeds data to the Internet every minute.&nbsp; For example, if you wanted to 
	know if things are calming down and you have a current strong east wind at 
	your location, go to the Guadalupe Pass (KGD) station and see if things are 
	getting stronger or weaker.&nbsp; This station is very sensitive to any wind 
	changes and you will see the trend easily here.&nbsp; However, it has no 
	history so you have to have been watching it a while.&nbsp; Note: the data 
	at some sites may be an hour old nor do some have a history of reported 
	conditions.</p>
	<p>*<a href="http://mesowest.utah.edu/cgi-bin/droman/meso_base.cgi?stn=NWSEP&amp;unit=0&amp;timetype=LOCAL">Santa 
	Teresa NWS</a> – The first station gives the current conditions at the 
	National Weather Service station in Santa Teresa, NM.&nbsp; It updated every 
	minute.&nbsp; This is, by far, our most accurate report of the current 
	conditions along with the history over the last (24) hours.&nbsp; It is easy 
	to see what the trends are.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/soundings/">SPC Balloon Soundings</a> – 
	(This is not the preferred site.&nbsp; See <a href="#UofW_Ballon_Soundings">U. of Wyoming</a> Balloon 
	Soundings below.)</p>
	<p id="UofW_Ballon_Soundings">
	<a href="http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.html">Balloon 
	Soundings</a> from the University of Wyoming -- 
	These soundings of the air temperature, dewpoint, speed, and 
	direction from the surface to the top of the atmosphere are available 
	roughly a 1/2 hour to an hour after the balloon is released at 00:00UTC and 
	12:00UTC (twice a day).&nbsp; This soundings site is easier to read and use than the SPC (Storm Prediction 
	Center) which, often enough, does not have the current data for what you may be looking for.</p>
	<p>
	The time is in the format "day-of-the-month/00Z or 12Z" which is 6AM or 6PM 
	MDT or 5:00AM MST and 5:00PM MST.&nbsp; "Z" refers to UTC time (Universal 
	Time Coordinated).&nbsp; This is the info you must study to see if it is 
	safe to fly as it will tell you what is going on per wind direction and 
	speed from the surface on up to the top of the atmosphere.</p>
	<p>
	Follow this link and, at the top of the screen, make 
	sure "Type of plot" is "Text: List".&nbsp; The date should be current and 
	the time will usually be when the last balloon was released which is every 
	12 hours at 00:00 and 12:00 UTC GMT.&nbsp; Once you set up the type of plot 
	and the correct time, click on the appropriate station.&nbsp; For us here in 
	the El Paso region it is "EPZ".&nbsp; On the plot for EPZ, the first column 
	is the altitude measured in mb/hPa.&nbsp; The second column is the altitude 
	in meters.&nbsp; Columns 7 &amp; 8 give you the wind direction and speed in 
	knots, respectively.</p>
	<p>Please refer to this <a href="SPC%20image.jpg">image of a typical Skew-T</a> sounding while reading the following: 1. The date should be current and the 
	time will usually be when the last balloon was released which is every 12 
	hours at 00:00 and 12:00UTC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Find the star which is at 
	our location (the El Paso station at Santa Teresa) and click it.&nbsp; This 
	will bring up the Skew-T.&nbsp; The altitude of the sounding is in 
	millibars/meters (left area of image).&nbsp; Here is the table too
	<a href="../weather-intro/FtMbs.pdf">convert these to feet</a>.&nbsp; For your convenience you can print it and post it by your 
	computer screen.&nbsp; The center of the image has the wind velocity and 
	direction.&nbsp; It has both wind barbs and bar graphs.&nbsp; Below the bar 
	graphs, you can see the velocities (20 40 60 80 100 120 knots).&nbsp; A knot 
	equals about 1.2 mph (here is the
	<a href="http://www.disastercenter.com/convert.htm">conversion chart</a> to 
	mph).&nbsp; Here is the info on how to read a 
	<a href="http://weather.rap.ucar.edu/info/about_windbarb.html">wind barb</a>.</p>
	<p>The Skew-T on the left side of the sounding tells us how buoyant the air 
	is for us soaring pilots. You must know how to read a Skew-T chart in order 
	to know, for example, the depth and strength of any inversions present in 
	the atmosphere.&nbsp; Here is a YouTube tutorial on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kexXhluHes">how to read a&nbsp; Skew-T</a>.&nbsp; Read this <a href="WhetherTheWeatherHD.pdf">introductory explanation</a> of the Skew-T 
	 – courtesy of <a href="http://www.xcmag.com">Cross Country magazine</a> 
	and Honza Rejmánek – used by permission.&nbsp; Honza is a paragliding pilot 
	and has written the best article on the Skew-T and it is specifically for 
	ultralight pilots.&nbsp; Get a cup of coffee or tea, sit down, and spend an 
	hour carefully reading this article by Honza.&nbsp; Then re-read it.&nbsp; 
	Here is&nbsp; another good 
	<a href="http://www.theweatherprediction.com/thermo/skewt/">explanation of the Skew-T</a> from the Weather Prediction guys.&nbsp; 
	Here is a <a href="GuideToSkewTLogPDiagram.pdf">definition of the basics</a>.&nbsp; 
	Here is the
	<a href="https://www.meted.ucar.edu/training_module.php?id=225#.U1aXsKIrHPT">
	advanced course</a> on the Skew-T (courtesy of Tom Bird of the NWS).</p>
	<p>Here is a Skew-T of a <a href="EPZSTSounding.pdf">good but uncommon day</a> here in the southwest.&nbsp; 
	Please note the consistent wind direction to a great altitude and the 
	absence of inversions from the ground to cloud base at 12,000' MSL.&nbsp; 
	The KINX value is &gt;35 which means that the atmosphere is unstable enough to 
	have numerous thunderstorms.&nbsp; This means the air is going up and there 
	will be cloud cover. The LIFT value is &gt;-2 means that the thunderstorms will 
	be not severe.&nbsp; The actual conditions experienced by pilots that day 
	confirmed the accuracy of the forecast.&nbsp; We have so few of these kinds 
	of days here.&nbsp; In places like the Midwest and Florida, they are more 
	common.</p>
	<p>Important note:&nbsp; Air masses below 8,000' MSL moving in an easterly direction towards the Franklin Mountains will tend to go through the pass that is SE of the NWS station in Santa Teresa.&nbsp; 
	In other words, balloon soundings below 8,000' MSL (the top of the Franklin Mountains) that have any easterly component will not be accurate per the direction of the air mass about 10 miles east 
	and west of the Franklin Mountain range.&nbsp; For example, as the air mass gets near the Potrillo ranges, its direction will not be influenced by the Franklin Mountains.</p>
	<p><a href="http://rucsoundings.noaa.gov/gwt/?data_source=Op40&amp;latest=latest&amp;n_hrs=12&amp;fcst_len=shortest&amp;airport=72364&amp;gwt=HTML5%20plot&amp;hydrometeors=false&amp;start=latest">OP40</a> Santa Teresa, NM provides forecasts of the Skew T, wind direction, and speed for our region (south central New Mexico and west Texas) 12 hours into the future.&nbsp; As the balloons go up 
	every 12 hours, this tool helps fill in the gaps between the times when the actual soundings are done.</p>
	<p><a href="http://rucsoundings.noaa.gov/">OP40 any location</a>&nbsp; Open this site and be sure "Op40" is selected.&nbsp; In the "Number of hours" box enter "12" or less.&nbsp; This tells the 
	program how many hours into the future you want the forecast to be.&nbsp; In the "Name(s)" box enter the coordinates of where you want the forecast to be located or, if available, enter the weather 
	station ID.&nbsp; The ID's of the reporting stations can be obtained by going to <a href="http://mesowest.utah.edu/index.html">MesoWest</a> and clicking on or near the desired 
	forecast location.&nbsp; This will bring up a map covered with black dots with a wind barb.&nbsp; Hover your cursor over one of black dots and the name and ID of the station will appear e.g. 
	"Ozona Municipal Ai KOZA OK".&nbsp; Note that some station ID's are not in the RUC system.&nbsp; The name is truncated to 18 characters so in this example "Airport" is shortened to "Ai".&nbsp; The next field is the ID of the station (KOZA),&nbsp; The last 
	field indicates whether the station is operating correctly (OK).&nbsp; Next, choose "Interactive plot".&nbsp; This is the simplest way to get most browsers to work with the RUC program.</p>
	<p>An alternative way to get the exact location you need is to enter the latitude and longitude in the "Name(s)" box e.g. "32.478792,-107.119341".&nbsp; This will give the best forecast but 
	requires a bit more information.&nbsp; The coordinates can be easily obtained from Google Earth.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;The 
	forecast will load.&nbsp; At the bottom is a table with the times (in UTC or Z).&nbsp; You will have to know your local time offset from UTC in order to know when the forecast is valid for some 
	local time.&nbsp; When you click on a time, the Skew-T and wind forecasts for that time will load.&nbsp; The farther out time-wise you go, the less reliable is the forecast.&nbsp; Always keep this 
	mind.&nbsp; To see the wind speed and direction and other details, move your cursor to the Skew-T graph and then move it up/down to observe the details of that altitude of the sounding.</p>

	hourly graphical forecast</a> is important because it forecasts gusting  –  a 
	particular hazard to us.&nbsp; It gives us both current conditions and 
	forecast for temp, wind speed, and direction for our region.&nbsp; It is not 
	as helpful for areas west, such as Kilbourne Hole maar.&nbsp; Instead, check 
	the trends of RTMA (see "Additional Tools" below) and the actual conditions 
	at Deming, NM via

	Meso West</a>.&nbsp; The NWS watches troughs that approach our area.&nbsp; 
	These areas of low pressure high in our atmosphere always generate pressure 
	waves that cause turbulence in the atmosphere (gusting).&nbsp; It is 
	important for paragliders that we heed any forecasts for gusting.&nbsp; The 
	Jet stream also causes severe gusting.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>*<a href="http://virga.sfsu.edu/gif/jetstream_init_00.gif">Jet Stream 
	location</a>&nbsp; If it is overhead, expect turbulence and gusting.&nbsp; 
	Severity depends on how strong it is.&nbsp; Unless you are flying early AM 
	in the inversion, it is better to stay out of the atmosphere when the Jet is 
	overhead.&nbsp; There is also a
	<a href="http://squall.sfsu.edu/scripts/namjetstream_modelsml_fcst.html">
	link</a> for the Jet Stream forecast up to (4) days in the future.&nbsp; 
	When the Jet is not overhead and there are no troughs or ridges moving 
	through, winds aloft in this region are usually smooth and organized.</p>

	USAirNet winds &amp; temp aloft</a> is important if you are getting near the 
	mountains or will have some altitude.&nbsp; However, it is just a forecast 
	tool and has little to do with wind speed and direction near the surface.&nbsp; 
	It is always better to check the
	<a href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/soundings/">NWS Raw Atmospheric 
	Soundings</a> and see what the winds were doing when the last balloon 
	went up and what the future might hold.&nbsp; Be careful if you fly in our 
	daily inversion when winds aloft at 6k' are greater than 20. The inversion 
	can dissipate suddenly and you may be going backwards  –  which can be 
	unsafe.&nbsp; In the late spring through the early fall, midday conditions 
	will be too strong and all pilots should be out of the air at that time.&nbsp; 
	As the weather balloons almost always drift east, these soundings get a 
	little less accurate the farther west you go, e.g., Mt. Riley.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.weather.gov/sat_loop.php?image=wv&amp;hours=24">NOAA 
	Satellite image</a> of clouds (water vapor) over west Texas and New Mexico.&nbsp; 
	This can tell us where the clouds are and possible areas of convergence 
	(eastern air meets western air -&gt; air that is going up).&nbsp; Cross country 
	flying of long range can be extraordinary at the right times.&nbsp; For 
	example, the Central Mountains of New Mexico will often be the boundary for 
	a convergence of eastern and western air.&nbsp; This is a great time to fly 
	in them!&nbsp; On a smaller scale, our local prevailing westerly winds will 
	often skip over the inversion bubble that is in the Rio Grande valley.&nbsp; 
	Where these two air masses meet there will be an area of lift (air going up) 
	that can be utilized by a soaring pilot.</p>
