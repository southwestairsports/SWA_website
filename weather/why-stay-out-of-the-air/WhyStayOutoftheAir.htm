	<h1>Why we should stay out of the air today</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p>Earlier today (April 10, 2013), I had this discussion with our
	<a href="http://www.rgsa.info/">RGSA</a> Safety Officer, Robin Hastings, why 
	pilots might want to stay on the ground.&nbsp; Be sure to also read the
	<a href="WhyStayOutoftheAir.htm">Introduction to Weather in the Southwest</a> if you have not already.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p>Do we want to get hurt, wreck our equipment, or have something worse (!) 
	happen?&nbsp; It is extremely important that we understand the weather in 
	our region.&nbsp; It is some of the most dicey air in the world because it 
	can change so RAPIDLY and/or be completely different just a few hundred feet 
	up or down or a mile or two in one direction or the other.&nbsp; One minute 
	the air is a pussycat.&nbsp; Then, in seconds, it can be brutal.&nbsp; For 
	this reason, pilots who learn how to safely fly in the desert southwest have 
	the tools that can enable them to fly anywhere in the world.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Why is our air so fickle and potentially so dangerous for our sport, 
	especially for paragliding?&nbsp; It is mainly because 1.) We are far from 
	the ocean, 2.) We are relatively high in altitude, 3.) We are located in the
	<a href="http://geography.about.com/od/physicalgeography/a/tradewinds.htm">
	Horse Latitudes</a>. 4.) We are in the vicinity of mountains and deep 
	valleys.</p>
	<p>Briefly, these four factors add up to air that is usually descending 
	(high pressure) which makes for sharp, intense, narrow thermals with rough 
	edges (vertical shear).&nbsp; Dry air from constant high pressure means few 
	clouds which are a great help in locating thermals when we have them.&nbsp; 
	Usually, we have to guess where the air is going up.&nbsp; Lack of clouds 
	and intense sun makes the thermals very strong during the middle of the day.&nbsp; 
	Being in the Horse Latitudes ensures that winds are often light and variable 
	and can change direction often.&nbsp; We can be exposed to radically 
	different layers of air in the atmosphere as we fly up through it.&nbsp; 
	That is, the direction, speed, moisture content, and temperature can be all 
	over the place.&nbsp; The oceans have enormous thermal mass.&nbsp; Air that 
	is next to great bodies of water tends to be stable or, at least, 
	predictable, like our southern Pacific coast.&nbsp; But this is the land of 
	mishmash air.&nbsp; Without careful analysis or help from our local 
	weatherman, we can put ourselves in danger quickly. For example, this is 
	what a fully inflated paraglider looks like when encountering virga  –  not a 
	pleasant experience.&nbsp; Thankfully, the pilot was not cocooned in the 
	glider, there was no cravat, and the glider started safely flying again 
	quickly.&nbsp; Anything else would have required a reserve toss over 
	mountainous territory  –  also a less than good option.&nbsp; The entire 
	event took less than 3 nerve-wracking seconds.</p>

	<p>Salton Sea Cold Front Event Feb. 11, 2012&nbsp; Like the southwest, the 
	desert just east of the Sierra Nevada can have sudden weather events that 
	are dangerous to ultralight aircraft.&nbsp; The pilot below failed to heed 
	clear warnings of a rapidly moving wave of strong air that was moving east 
	across the desert from the Pacific coast.&nbsp; With help, he was barely 
	able to land without injury or being blown out over water  –  this time.&nbsp; 
	Another pilot was, in fact, blown out to sea.&nbsp; He narrowly escaped 
	drowning.&nbsp; Both pilots should have landed but chose not to.&nbsp; Is it 
	"cool" to risk your life?&nbsp; Many pilots choose to deliberately play a 
	form of Russian Roulette.&nbsp; The search and rescue team that attempted a 
	rescue of the latter pilot must think ultralight pilots are incredibly 
	stupid and careless.&nbsp; This is not to mention the waste of taxpayer's 
	money that resulted from sending a fully equipped rescue helicopter for 
	someone who acted foolishly.</p>
	<p>
<img alt="gust front" src="IMG_6191.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>While flying in the mountains to the northwest of the Sea, I saw the 
	leading edge of this front sneaking in from miles away (dust kicking up).&nbsp; 
	The heavy, cold air went along the low areas and then spread out.&nbsp; The 
	mountains blocked the flow and were probably safe but why take a chance?&nbsp; 
	I landed ASAP.</p>
	<p>
<img alt="dust being kicked up by a gust front" src="IMG_6187.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>Today's Analysis (a sample of what pilots should always do before flying)</p>
	<p>The NWS forecast is for some short wave impulses (low pressure waves 
	moving along high in the atmosphere) that are on the tail end of the storm 
	leaving the area.&nbsp; These impulses cause the air in front of them to go 
	up and cause gusting (forecast is for the effects to start about 9AM).&nbsp; 
	Things are calm here both in the valley and at the Dona Ana County Airport 
	but it is because of the
	<a href="../weather-intro/WeatherIntro.htm">inversion</a> which will soon be gone by mid/early morning. Conditions 
	northwest of the Las Cruces Airport and further west of us are different. At 
	7AM, Deming is already west at 7 mph (not bad).</p>
	<p>Things would have been flyable from maybe 7am until 9am but it would 
	rapidly become too strong for all but the best PG pilots (west at 15 is 
	forecast by the GFS model by late morning). It is the gusting from the short 
	wave impulses and the Jet that should always concern pilots. It is extremely 
	important that pilots take a look at the
	<a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?w0=t&amp;w3=sfcwind&amp;w3u=1&amp;w12u=1&amp;w13u=1&amp;AheadHour=0&amp;Submit=Submit&amp;FcstType=graphical&amp;textField1=31.87330&amp;textField2=-106.64100&amp;site=all&amp;unit=0">
	hourly weather forecast</a> from the NWS or, at least, read the day's
	<a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=NWS&amp;issuedby=EPZ&amp;product=AFD&amp;format=CI&amp;version=1&amp;glossary=1">
	forecast discussion</a>.&nbsp; None of the models are designed to forecast 
	atmospheric turbulence (gusting) that could be dangerous to ultralights.</p>
	<p>So I am flying at 8:45AM and the gusting forecast was off a bit. It could 
	be a concern. For example, I landed late Saturday and got whacked. Just as I 
	touched down the winds took off 
	18+ or so and I got nicely dragged across 
	some of the grass at the sod farm.&nbsp; I knew gusting was forecast for the 
	time I was in the air but it was so nice flying around.&nbsp; As I went up, 
	wind speed increased and there was turbulence  –  all signs of something 
	strong coming in.&nbsp; Getting dragged a bit at the sod farm is one thing 
	(easy, no damage, no harm, etc.) but getting dragged anywhere else? It could 
	damage equipment and cause injury. Lee Boone and I both have been rattled by 
	gusting from the Jet, as well. It can happen so quickly and is completely 
	without warning. I was at the top of
	<a href="../../SiteInfo/MtRiley/MtRiley.htm">Mt. Riley</a> in nice balmy air but I wanted to be sure the Jet wasn't going 
	to do stuff (it always does, anyway, but I wanted to be sure) so I waited 
	around. Sure enough, a 35 mph gust came through out of nowhere. If I had 
	been in the air, probably no problem but what if I was setting up for a 
	landing or had been soaring close to the rocks?&nbsp; I muttered some words 
	and made the 40 minute hike back down the peak with all of my gear.&nbsp; 
	Why be stupid? Those pilots who choose to ignore the weather might be lucky 
	then again.... Today might have been safe for PG for 2 hours or so very 
	early.&nbsp; But, to be safe, we should get out of the air an hour before 
	the gusting is forecast. That leaves a nervous hour to fly for us. I did not 
	think it was worth it. These impulses combined with the Jet can cascade into 
	a dangerous wave of turbulence which is what I think happened when I was at 
	Mt. Riley.&nbsp; Air and water are subject to the laws of physics and behave 
	in similar ways.&nbsp; The ocean coasts are subject to
	<a href="http://faculty.deanza.edu/donahuemary/stories/storyReader$963">
	sneaker waves</a>.&nbsp; These are extremely dangerous waves that can be 
	many times higher and stronger than the average wave coming in.&nbsp; Many 
	have been drowned by these monsters that appear out of nowhere, even on calm 
	sunny days.</p>
	<p>The atmosphere can be the same under certain conditions when the effects 
	of extreme winds (the Jet) and short wave troughs/impulses are present and 
	then combine.&nbsp; Mixing of these effects can cause the dangerous 
	turbulence which can spit a pilot out of the air.</p>
	<p>Conclusion:&nbsp; Make sure the air is relatively clean and smooth up to 
	30,000' MSL before flying in it.&nbsp; This is why the NWS gusting forecasts 
	are so critical for ultralight pilots.&nbsp; Any pilot who has 100's of 
	hours of flight time can tell you a story of how he was just flying along 
	calmly and, suddenly, without warning got whacked badly out of nowhere.&nbsp; 
	We need to minimize or eliminate these frightening and potentially dangerous 
	experiences.&nbsp; That is why we carefully study the weather before flying 
	in it.</p>
	<p>Remember that you alone are responsible for determining whether it is 
	safe to fly or not. &nbsp;</p>
