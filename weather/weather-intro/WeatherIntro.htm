	<h1>Introduction to weather in the Southwest</h1>
by Had Robinson with much assistance from Tom 
	Bird and our weathermen at the National Weather Service  –  thank you!
	
	<h2>When is it safe to fly?</h2>
	<p>It depends on the weather, the time of day, the skill of the pilot, his 
	equipment, and whether he is flying HG, PG, or PPG.&nbsp; Why stay out of 
	the air?&nbsp; Read
	<a href="../why-stay-out-of-the-air/WhyStayOutoftheAir.htm">this report</a> and you decide.</p>
	<p>Generally, HG pilots can fly anytime of day if the winds/weather are 
	safe.&nbsp; Thermal strength is generally not an issue as HG handles 
	negative G's and turbulence much better.</p>
	<p>With all forms of paragliding, it is not so simple.&nbsp; Firstly, the 
	weather/winds have to be safe.&nbsp; That is, they must be within the 
	pilot's comfort margin and skill level.&nbsp; His flying equipment must be 
	appropriate for the conditions.&nbsp; Secondly, the pilot must consider the 
	strength of the thermals at the time he is in the air.</p>
	<p><span class="auto-style1">Soaring above the desert near Santa Teresa, NM.&nbsp; 
	We had one of those special days for our region!&nbsp; Winds were light, the 
	atmosphere moderately unstable, and there was moisture in the air!&nbsp; Air 
	was going up everywhere and it was easy to thermal to cloud base (around 
	10,000' MSL).&nbsp; Thermals were big, fat, powerful, and smooth (for our 
	region).&nbsp; This 
	kind of air doesn't occur more than 20 times a year here.&nbsp; When it 
	does, drop everything and fly!</span><br><br>

	<h2>(6) Guidelines for Safe Flying in the Southwest</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>&nbsp;PG pilots can generally fly anytime during the day from late 
		October until February.<br></li>
		<li>&nbsp;From late February - early October, pilots have to be more 
		concerned about thermal intensity and accompanying shear turbulence 
		during the heat of the day.&nbsp; Why are thermals so intense here 
		(crazy)?&nbsp; It has to do with the night and day temperature 
		difference which, in the desert, is often extreme.&nbsp; Generally, a pilot may safely fly the 
		periods Sunrise + (3) hours; Sunset - (2 1/2) hours.&nbsp; For example, 
		on June 15th sunrise is around 6:15AM and sunset is around 8:15PM.&nbsp; 
		Therefore, a pilot should not fly after 9:15AM nor launch before 5:45PM.&nbsp; 
		More experienced pilots might add an hour or so to the times given here.&nbsp; 
		These times are roughly for the hottest part of the season and can be 
		modified at the other times.<br></li>
		<li>&nbsp;If it is overcast or there is substantial cloud cover, thermal 
		strength will be much less, even negligible.&nbsp; The 5-5 Rule (no 
		gusts greater than 5 mph in less than 5 seconds) is an excellent rule 
		for pilots.&nbsp; Strong thermals out in front of launch will certainly 
		cause blocking of incoming air and pilots will know right away how 
		strong the thermals are.&nbsp; The more laminar the air is at launch, 
		the weaker are the thermals you will encounter in the area.<br></li>
		<li>&nbsp;If things like
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_devils">dust devils</a>,
		<a href="../virga/virga.htm">virga</a>, and
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towering_cumulus_cloud">towering 
		clouds</a> are present, DO NOT LAUNCH.&nbsp; A good rule concerning 
		virga is: if you can see it, stay on or get to the ground.&nbsp; Most of 
		the time virga has no effect where a pilot might be but why take 
		chances?&nbsp; We have been surprised  –  thankfully we were on the 
		ground.<br></li>
		<li>&nbsp;If the
		<a href="http://virga.sfsu.edu/gif/jetstream_init_00.gif">Jet Stream</a> 
		is overhead it can mix with the air below and cause turbulence, 
		especially if there is any thermal activity or pressure waves moving 
		through the atmosphere.&nbsp; 
		It is best not to launch, especially if you are in the 
		mountains.&nbsp; Our experience flying in the southwest has 
		proven that the Jet can cause serious turbulence.&nbsp; If there is a substantial subsidence inversion between you and the Jet, you will most likely be OK and Jet turbulence will be isolated 
		above the air mass you are flying in.<br></li>
		<li>&nbsp;If you get past the above (5), then do the following:<br><br>
		a.)
		<a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?site=epz&amp;map.x=218&amp;map.y=163">
		El Paso National Weather Service</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Read the 7-day 
		forecast.&nbsp; It is good to know if changes are in store, like a 
		sudden appearance of a front which can mean turbulent air.<br><br>b.)
		<a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?w0=t&amp;w3=sfcwind&amp;w3u=1&amp;w12u=1&amp;w13u=1&amp;AheadHour=0&amp;Submit=Submit&amp;FcstType=graphical&amp;textField1=31.87330&amp;textField2=-106.64100&amp;site=all&amp;unit=0">
		NWS hourly graphical forecast</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the wind speed, 
		direction, and temperature trends over the day.&nbsp; Stay OUT OF THE 
		AIR if there is gusting forecasted when you want to fly.&nbsp; If 
		gusting is forecast, it generally means some disturbance (trough or 
		ridge of pressure) is passing overhead.<br><br>c.)&nbsp;
		<a href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/soundings/">NWS Raw Atmospheric 
		Soundings</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is the
		<a href="../tools-info/ToolInfo.htm">explanation</a> of how to use this critical 
		information.&nbsp; If you see high winds (&gt;25 mph) anywhere less than 
		18,000' MSL (510 mb) you might want to stay on the ground because of 
		turbulence caused by mixing of the atmospheric layers.<br><br>d.)&nbsp;
		<a href="http://mesowest.utah.edu/cgi-bin/droman/mesomap.cgi?state=EPZfwz&amp;rawsflag=3">
		Meso West Region</a>&nbsp; This is one of our most helpful sites in 
		seeing what may be ahead in the short term and reports the weather 
		conditions of dozens of stations in our area.&nbsp; To see what is going 
		on in our region: Set "Network" to "All Networks", Overlays 1 &amp; 2 to 
		"Current Wind Speed" and "Current Wind Gust", respectively.&nbsp; Set 
		the Radius tab to 150 miles.&nbsp; Click "Refresh Map".&nbsp; Zoom in to 
		see what is going on in your particular area of interest.&nbsp; To see 
		the trend over 24 hours, click on the desired weather station and then 
		the "wind" tab to see how the speed and gusts are trending.&nbsp; Click 
		on the "Vector Wind" tab to see the trend in wind direction.&nbsp; 
		Station Santa Teresa NWS R (our local NWS station) feeds data to the 
		Internet every minute.&nbsp; For example, if you wanted to know if 
		things are calming down and you have a current strong east wind at your 
		location, go to the Guadalupe Pass (KGD) station and see if things are 
		getting stronger or weaker.&nbsp; This station is very sensitive to any 
		wind changes and you will see the trend easily here.&nbsp; However, it 
		has no history so you have to have been watching it a while.&nbsp; For 
		south central New Mexico and west El Paso always check the
		<a href="http://mesowest.utah.edu/cgi-bin/droman/meso_base.cgi?stn=NWSEP&amp;unit=0&amp;timetype=LOCAL">
		NWS Santa Teresa Station</a>, as well.&nbsp; Note: the data at some 
		sites may be an hour old nor do some have a history of reported 
		conditions.<br><br>e.) Optional:&nbsp; Subscribe to
		<a href="http://www.xcskies.com/">XC Skies</a> and check what the thermals will be doing and, especially, the wind speed and direction at the altitude of where you plan to launch, fly, and 
		land.&nbsp; If you do not have a computer, you can listen to the National Weather Service broadcasts.&nbsp; These <a href="../tools-info/ToolInfo.htm">frequencies</a> can be accessed by many radios.&nbsp; If you do not have a 
		radio, pilots may call
		<a href="../tools-info/ToolInfo.htm">WXBrief</a> via a cell phone and speak with a trained weather analyst.&nbsp; 
		It is free and the analysts are always helpful.<br></li>
		<li>&nbsp;If everything looks good to this point, go fly.&nbsp; Always 
		remember that the forecasts can be wrong.&nbsp; The only SURE data we 
		have are the balloon soundings and our own observations.&nbsp; For $40 
		(as of 2014), a pilot can go by Party World and pick up a helium 
		cylinder, some balloons, and be your own weatherman (sort of).&nbsp; It is amazing 
		what we have observed sending up our balloons over the years.&nbsp; FLY 
		SAFELY! Read on for some general information on what constitutes "safe 
		conditions".&nbsp; Remember that you must make the decision to fly or 
		not  –  it is solely your responsibility.&nbsp; If in doubt, STAY ON THE 
		GROUND.</li>

	</ol>
	<p class="auto-style1">A powerful, towering cumulonimbus cloud forming over 
	the Franklin Mountains in El Paso, TX.&nbsp; Ordinarily, moist air is heated 
	near the ground, rises, and condenses completely into a cloud at the 
	altitude known as cloud base.&nbsp; Cloud base is the altitude where the dew 
	point and temperature of the air are the same.&nbsp; However, here the 
	conditions are just right and there is plenty of warm moist air that is 
	still condensing into water droplets at cloud base, releasing more heat, and 
	gaining even more velocity to penetrate the colder air above (the warmer a 
	gas is, the more buoyant it is).&nbsp; It will keep moving up in a vicious 
	cycle, condensing, releasing heat, and going higher until there is no more 
	condensable moisture in the air mass.&nbsp; Wind velocity inside these 
	monsters can exceed 100 mph and the cloud can top out at over 60,000' high.&nbsp; 
	When the rain droplets/hail get heavy enough to overcome the upward wind 
	velocity, we have precipitation that reaches the ground.&nbsp; Pilots have 
	been sucked into these clouds and trapped  –  with often unhappy results.&nbsp; 
	Even heavy aircraft stay away from them.<br><br>
	<img alt="Towering cumulonimbus cloud" src="DSC01927.JPG" width="1024" height="768">&nbsp;
	</p>
	
	<h2>Wind Speed &amp; Direction</h2>
      <p>Surface winds should not be more than 17 mph for foot launched PG, much 
	less for PPG, and even less flying a trike/quad.&nbsp; These are only 
	estimates – it's up to the pilot to decide what conditions he is comfortable 
	in.&nbsp; Always be sure to check the winds aloft before launching as we 
	need to know what's going on above us.&nbsp; In particular, winds aloft may 
	be 180 degrees different than at the surface and this will cause turbulence 
	above launch and problems in trying to bench up from our mountain sites.&nbsp; 
	Generally, our best air is from the WSW at the surface and the direction is 
	within 30 degrees or so for the next 10,000' AGL of altitude.&nbsp; If 
	barometric pressure is dropping or low, we can expect more buoyant air which 
	is more fun to fly in.</p>
	<h2>Clouds</h2>
	<p>If there is 50% cloud cover, for example, thermals will be suppressed and 
	we can enjoy calmer air all day long.&nbsp; However, the clouds must not be 
	towering nor threatening rain, virga, or hail.&nbsp; Sunny clear weather 
	pretty much guarantees the presence of thermals and turbulent air so we have 
	to be careful what time of day we launch.&nbsp; Inversions in the atmosphere 
	almost guarantee that thermals will not rise above the top of the inversion.&nbsp; 
	As the day continues, the air near the ground will be turbulent everywhere 
	as the hotter shallow air mixes with the air aloft.&nbsp; In the fall and 
	winter, the heating of the sun is much less and thermals and turbulence will 
	be weaker.&nbsp; It is often possible to fly all day during this season.&nbsp; 
	We like thermals but ones that are not too strong.</p>
	<p><span class="auto-style1">Cirrus clouds over El Paso  –  these clouds were 
	formed hundreds of miles southwest of us and were subsequently subjected to 
	mixing from high winds aloft and were shredded.</span> <br><br>
	<img alt="Cirrus clouds" src="DSC00466.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<h2>For PG (free flying)</h2>
	<p>we like modestly strong thermals that average around 600'/min.&nbsp; When 
	the air is stronger than this, we risk a collapse of our glider because of 
	turbulence in the vicinity of the occasional thermal which may be much 
	stronger than average.&nbsp; Low barometric pressure encourages thermals 
	to&nbsp;be more organized and smooth, rise more easily, and gain more speed.&nbsp; 
	There is less turbulence near thermals during low barometric pressure 
	conditions.&nbsp; If the
	<a href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/soundings/help/lapse.html">lapse rate</a> 
	(the normal cooling of the atmosphere with altitude) is also "steep", it 
	will guarantee that the thermals will ascend to great altitudes in the
	<a href="http://www.srh.weather.gov/srh/jetstream/atmos/layers.htm">
	troposphere</a> and a pilot will be able to also get very high.&nbsp; 
	Inversions (where the air becomes warmer with altitude) can stop the rise of 
	thermals like a brick wall and, consequently, can limit the height which a 
	pilot can also rise.&nbsp; Some thermals are so strong that they can 
	penetrate an inversion.&nbsp; If a pilot is lucky enough to find such a 
	strong thermal, he can go right up with it and leave other pilots thousands 
	of feet below.</p>
	<p>With high barometric pressure (fairly normal for the southwest), thermals 
	tend to be sharp edged with great turbulence between areas of ascending and 
	descending air.&nbsp; This vertical shear often causes collapses in a 
	paraglider as the pilot moves through them.&nbsp; They usually spontaneously 
	recover but are not an enjoyable event when they occur.&nbsp; While the 
	average strength can be 600'/min, for example, an occasional "boomer" can 
	drift through which can be much, much stronger than the average (1,200'/min, 
	for example).&nbsp; There are tools, like
	<a href="http://www.xcskies.com/">XC Skies</a>, that can help 
	us estimate the average strength of the thermals for the day.&nbsp; If we 
	fly too early or too late, we will not find lift.&nbsp; If we fly in the 
	middle of the day during late spring, summer, and early fall, we may find 
	thermal strength to be excessive.&nbsp; What is excessive for one pilot may 
	be too little for another  –  this is what flying skill and knowledge is all 
	about.&nbsp; If we can find ridge lift (when air hits a vertical surface, 
	like a cliff) we prefer to fly either very early or very late in the day as 
	we do not need the presence of thermals to stay up.&nbsp; However, it is 
	never wise to fly in thermals and ridge lift at the same time as the ridge 
	lift tends to concentrate or merge thermals.</p>
	<h2>For PPG (powered paragliding)</h2>
	<p>we usually prefer calm air which means launching at dawn or in an 
	inversion.&nbsp; Typically here in the desert, the air does not get 
	excessively thermic during the late spring, summer, and early fall until 
	about 10AM, daylight time.&nbsp; This can vary, however, but pilots can tell 
	when the air starts to get active and they can then choose to land.&nbsp; 
	Things start calming down around 5:00PM.&nbsp; The air is always the calmest 
	at dawn.&nbsp; Modest thermic activity will make the air turbulent but it is 
	not dangerous.&nbsp; If you never want to experience a collapse, fly at 
	these times.&nbsp; If you fly at dawn and are also within an inversion, you 
	will experience the calmest air possible.&nbsp; (See below for info on 
	flying in an inversion.)&nbsp; </p>
	<h2>Time</h2>
	<p>The time of all weather related info is often given in "Z" (zulu), "UTC" 
	(universal time coordinated)&nbsp; For example, it is (6) hours later than 
	MDT and (7) hours later than MST.&nbsp; Here is an
	<a href="GMTLocalTimeChart.pdf">easy to read chart</a> published 
	by the NWS of U.S. local times converted to UTC time.&nbsp; GMT time can be different than UTC because the former time 
	zone observes daylight savings time.</p>
	<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
	<p>Altitude and air pressure are 
	often expressed in millibars.&nbsp; Here is a <a href="FtMbs.pdf">millibars to feet conversion table</a>.&nbsp; 
	Here is a <a href="MbstoInHG.pdf">millibars to inches of Hg. conversion table 
	</a>(barometer 
	readings).&nbsp; Go here for an explanation of
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_weather_analysis">weather symbols</a> and how to do a surface weather analysis.</p>
	<h2>Rio Grande Valley Microclimates</h2>
	<p>There are at least (4) micro-climates in south central New Mexico and west 
	Texas.&nbsp; Throughout the year we typically have a daily inversion that 
	forms in the Rio Grande valley on the west side of El Paso.&nbsp; An 
	inversion means that we have a still body of air to fly in that can be 
	easily 1,000' thick or more.&nbsp; These inversions are very resistant to 
	disturbances from layers of air that are moving above them.&nbsp; East of 
	the Franklin Mountains, the inversions are not as strong and are of much 
	less significance for us ultralight pilots.&nbsp; The mesa west of the Rio 
	Grande valley rim is still another climate zone.&nbsp; As we move away from 
	the valley the inversion gets thinner (and thus weaker) than in the valley.&nbsp; 
	There is a daily inversion out in the desert but it is even weaker and 
	thinner than in the mesa on the west rim of the valley.&nbsp; It is often 
	less than 50' in thickness.&nbsp; The
	<a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?w0=t&amp;w3=sfcwind&amp;w3u=1&amp;w12u=1&amp;w13u=1&amp;AheadHour=0&amp;Submit=Submit&amp;FcstType=graphical&amp;textField1=31.87330&amp;textField2=-106.64100&amp;site=all&amp;unit=0">
	raw atmospheric soundings</a> will give you a good idea of how thick the 
	inversion is (if any) for your particular region.&nbsp; If the inversion is 
	higher up in the atmosphere, it can be a
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capping_inversion">capping inversion</a>.&nbsp; 
	Such inversions radically affect the formation of storms.</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">Two fronts (bodies of air) colliding near Ft. Davis, 
	TX.&nbsp; Warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico (lower layer) meets cooler 
	dry air from Rockies.&nbsp; This sort of event is hazardous for soaring 
	pilots if they are flying in the vicinity.&nbsp; The shredded clouds 
	indicate high winds at that altitude.&nbsp; It would not be fun to be flying 
	an ultralight anywhere near this sort of weather.<br><br>
	<img alt="Two bodies of air colliding" src="DSC02465.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<h2>The Daily Inversion in the Valley</h2>
	<p>Unfortunately, weather forecasts usually do not take into account the presence of 
	inversions, especially if they are near the earth's surface.&nbsp; Who really cares  –  except us ultralight pilots who fly in 
	them?&nbsp; This is why the forecasts may say winds are "such and such" but 
	you step outside and it is calm.&nbsp; Late in the afternoon, even while the 
	sun is still up, the earth rapidly cools off by radiating heat into space.&nbsp; 
	This is what forms the inversion – a layer of air near the ground which is 
	much cooler than the air above it. We learn in physics class that liquids or 
	gases of different temperatures do not tend to mix. As the body of air cools 
	near the ground, it becomes more stable and becomes isolated from the air 
	masses above it.&nbsp; The inversion typically lasts until mid morning the 
	next day and is about 1,300' thick (from the ground at about 3,700' MSL to 
	over 5,000' MSL).&nbsp; It can be easy to see an inversion because the air 
	within it traps pollution.&nbsp; This is why there is usually a thick smoky 
	haze&nbsp;over the valley and also over Juarez every morning. Where the 
	haze/smoke ends is the top of the inversion.&nbsp; Inversions are useful 
	events for us because they stop strong winds aloft from reaching down 
	through the inversion and affecting our flying.</p>
	<p>What shape is the inversion? My experience flying in inversions suggest 
	that they have a flat shape but curve down and thin out at the edges. The 
	eastern edge of our daily inversion is the Franklin mountains and the 
	western edge is a mile or two west of the Doña Ana County airport.&nbsp; If 
	you get west of the valley and up on the rim, you can see the haze which 
	usually ends just below the pass at Transmountain  –  which is just over 
	5,000' MSL.&nbsp; The area east of the Franklin Mountains rarely experiences 
	a significant inversion.</p>
	<p><span class="auto-style1">Below is a typical inversion over the Rio 
	Grande valley (not visible, far in the distance, and just in front of the 
	mountains).&nbsp; The inversion is particularly visible because of the 
	immense amount of smoke generated by the city of Juarez, Mexico which mixes 
	with the much cleaner air found in El Paso.&nbsp; The inversion is isolated 
	from the air above it because it is so much cooler.&nbsp; The inversion 
	appears weaker towards the left of the photo but that is because of the 
	presence of less pollution from Juarez.&nbsp; The depth of the inversion is 
	typically 1,000' to 1,500' in thickness from the base of the valley.&nbsp; 
	Today it is about 1,400' as we can see the top of it which almost reaches 
	Transmountain Pass.</span> <br><br>
	<img alt="inversion over the Rio Grande valley" src="2012-02-18%2008.35.03.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
	<p>Why do we care about this daily inversion?&nbsp; It means that winds 
	aloft can be some speed and direction but the air near the ground within the 
	inversion is calm, particularly in the Rio Grande valley.&nbsp; If you study 
	the soundings and forecasts carefully, in particular upstream (up wind) of 
	where you would like to fly, you can predict when it is safe to fly even 
	when winds aloft are strong – and potentially unsuitable or unsafe to fly 
	in.</p>
	<p>When winds aloft are relative light or moderate, the inversion is a 
	nuisance, especially if we are interested in thermalling away that day.&nbsp; 
	This is because the inversion traps everything in it, including thermals.&nbsp; 
	Thermals will go up in an inversion and, when they reach the top of it, will 
	abruptly stop.&nbsp; My experience in ascending within a thermal that formed 
	in an inversion is that there is sudden turbulent air when the thermal 
	reaches the top of the inversion.&nbsp; Imagine squirting a garden hose at a 
	brick wall.&nbsp; It goes along fine until it hits the brick and then it 
	goes everywhere.&nbsp; It is just the same.&nbsp; If you are not expecting 
	this turbulence it can be frightening.&nbsp; The best thing is to just get 
	away from the thermal as fast as possible.&nbsp; If you are very lucky, the 
	thermal might just be strong enough to punch a hole through the top of the 
	inversion  –  something I have yet to experience.</p>
	<p><span class="auto-style1">Line clouds over the Franklin Mountains in El 
	Paso, TX.&nbsp; This event was caused by warm moist air coming from the east 
	moving west and being pushed up and over the mountains.&nbsp; As it went up, 
	the temperature dropped below the dew point and clouds formed.&nbsp; As it 
	continued on, the air mass dropped down on the other side and the clouds 
	were re-absorbed.<br><br></span>

	<p>Winds aloft are usually from the west or southwest.&nbsp; If winds near 
	the surface are moderate or strong from the east, for example, you can 
	expect gusting when flying.&nbsp; If the Jet stream is overhead, gusting can 
	be particularly dangerous if there is no inversion that can protect us.&nbsp; 
	For example, I once hiked all the way to the top of Mt. Riley expecting to 
	enjoy the good flying conditions that day but the Jet was overhead.&nbsp; I 
	spent about 30 minutes at launch just studying the air.&nbsp; It was coming 
	in at a steady 10-14 mph from the southeast.&nbsp; And then  –  wham  –  a 35+ 
	mph gust from the Jet hit the summit of Mt. Riley.&nbsp; I packed up my 
	glider and hiked back down....&nbsp; It was a simple and easy decision.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p>Generally, if there is ridge or trough moving overhead (gusting forecast) 
	do not plan on flying that day, especially if the Jet is overhead which will 
	increase the turbulence of the air below.&nbsp; You will often encounter 
	mild to moderate turbulence flying through an inversion layer into winds 
	aloft or back into the inversion, especially if the wind direction of each 
	layer is different. If you have no idea what is going on in the atmosphere, 
	you might be frightened at encountering turbulence "out of nowhere."&nbsp; 
	That is why we should not be ignorant of the weather  –  it really is not 
	rocket science.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, your personal safety depends on 
	knowing what is going on.</p>

	<h2>Guidelines if you wish to safely fly within an inversion 
	(either HG, PG, or PPG)</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Always check the
		<a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?site=epz&amp;map.x=218&amp;map.y=163">
		NWS El Paso Forecast</a> before you do anything.&nbsp; It will let you 
		know what the trend is for the day and, especially, if there is any 
		gusting.&nbsp; Gusting can happen anytime during the forecast period so 
		if the forecast includes gusting that is over 18 or 20 mph, it is 
		probably wise to stay on the ground.<br></li>
		<li>If you are flying in west El Paso, go to the
		<a href="http://mesowest.utah.edu/cgi-bin/droman/meso_base.cgi?stn=NWSEP&amp;unit=0&amp;timetype=LOCAL">
		NWS Santa Teresa Station</a> and see what the surface winds are doing.&nbsp; 
		This station has very accurate equipment and gives the minute by minute 
		conditions.&nbsp; The latest 
		<a href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/soundings/">atmospheric sounding data</a> 
		will tell you what winds aloft are doing.&nbsp; This sounding 
		data is only helpful 100' or more above the surface as the lower 
		readings are not accurate.&nbsp; It is worth checking the
		<a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=Deming&amp;state=NM&amp;site=EPZ&amp;textField1=32.2617&amp;textField2=-107.75&amp;e=0">
		Deming branch of the NWS</a> if the winds are westerly as they are 
		upwind of us.<br></li>
		<li>You should not fly in the morning if winds aloft (above 6,000' 
		MSL for our region) are strong (&gt;35 mph) or are getting stronger.&nbsp; 
		You will have to check the forecast to see if some disturbance is on its 
		way that might cause the winds aloft to increase and quickly blow out 
		the inversion.&nbsp; You can tell when the inversion is getting ready to 
		dissipate as the air becomes "twitchy."&nbsp; If you sense anything 
		other than dead air when in the inversion, it is time to land. 3. The 
		evening is the safest time to fly because the inversion gets 
		thicker/stronger which increases its depth and more safely isolates the 
		pilot from the winds aloft.&nbsp; Usually our inversions end at around 
		5,000’ MSL (the same height as the pass at Transmountain) so stay well 
		below this altitude if winds aloft are strong.&nbsp; This gives us about 
		1,300’ of air to fly/play in if we launch from somewhere in the valley.&nbsp; 
		If we launch at the sod farm, this value is around 1,000'.&nbsp; If you 
		live in another region, the Skew-T will tell you exactly where and how 
		thick the daily inversion is.&nbsp; Always check the forecast for the 
		evening  –  there may be a high level trough coming through which will 
		prevent the inversion from forming because of the presence of high 
		winds.&nbsp; The downside of evening flying in the high desert is that 
		the inversion can be 20' in thickness and a pilot has no idea what the 
		air is doing just above.&nbsp; This pilot once launched just at dusk 
		going into a light wind.&nbsp; But just 5' off the ground, the air above 
		was going the opposite direction and he literally fell out of the air.&nbsp; 
		There was damage to the equipment but, thankfully, no injuries.&nbsp; 
		Had he sent up a balloon, it would have showed the quirky, unpredictable 
		winds that occur in and near an inversion.<br></li>
		<li>&nbsp;<span class="auto-style2">WARNING:</span> Be certain that 
		higher winds aloft (&gt;35 mph at 6k' MSL) are not forecast for the 
		evening! This pilot once had the misfortune of not checking this 
		important bit of info and launched in the late afternoon inversion and 
		guess what? It was blown out by howling winds above and I wound up 
		FLYING BACKWARDS for a few miles. How did the pilot save his skin?&nbsp; 
		He allowed himself to be blown over the valley and then quickly 
		descended. The inversion was still holding there and he easily landed. 
		He was never in any real danger but he could have been dragged badly had 
		the inversion blown out everywhere. The good news is – from our 
		experience – that winds aloft above 6,000’ MSL need to be well over 30 
		mph or so for the inversion not to hold.&nbsp; Always keep your head and 
		fly your glider.&nbsp; Pilots have been hurt because of panic.<br></li>
		<li>&nbsp;Check the morning soundings to determine how thick the 
		inversion is and what the winds aloft are.<br></li>
		<li>&nbsp;Do NOT fly higher than the top of the inversion minus a few 
		hundred feet unless you know that winds aloft are not strong.&nbsp; 
		Ordinarily, stay below 4,500' MSL or 500' above the surface of the sod 
		farm.&nbsp; However, I have had fun flying out of the inversion into the 
		winds aloft and moving rapidly across the earth.&nbsp; Once, I was able 
		to achieve a ground speed of over 55 mph.<br></li>
		<li>&nbsp;Come down by 10 AM (MST) or 9 AM (MDT).&nbsp; These times can 
		be increased an hour or so if there is cloud cover or other 
		circumstances that mitigate the dissipation of the inversion.<br></li>
		<li>&nbsp;If you have doubts or don't understand the weather well 
		enough, stay on the ground.&nbsp; Don't rely on others for making your 
		decision to fly.&nbsp; You are responsible for your own safety!</li>

	<h2>Daily Wind Patterns</h2>
	<p>Light winds from the north are common in the early AM in the valley.&nbsp; 
	These winds are a result of the daily inversion which forms for hundreds of 
	miles in the Rio Grande river valley.&nbsp; Imagine that the valley contains 
	a huge lake of cooler air and what does it do?&nbsp; It flow downhill, just 
	like water.&nbsp; In fact this effect can be quite strong in some areas, 
	particularly near the lakes about 100 miles north of us.&nbsp; Winds there 
	are hardly light and sometimes reach 15-20 mph.&nbsp; Like here, they 
	suddenly end around 10AM as the inversion dissipates.&nbsp; If you drive 
	north on I-25 you will see warning signs about gusty winds posted next to 
	the deep canyons that the interstate highway traverses.&nbsp; At the end of 
	the day, sudden cooling of the air in the mountains can unleash a torrent of 
	air that races down these canyons towards the Rio Grande valley.&nbsp; To a 
	lesser extent, we experience this
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katabatic_wind">katabatic</a> flow 
	when we fly late in the day in the Franklins.&nbsp; Often, the winds near 
	the base of these mountains will reverse  –  going from east to west.&nbsp; 
	This is why it is good to have windsocks in the LZ and pay attention to 
	them.</p>
	<p>Going to the sod farm on the west rim of the valley, the early morning 
	winds may be different still.&nbsp; They may be from the west as the cold 
	night air continues its flow, draining towards the valley from the 
	surrounding desert mesa and the Potrillo Mountains.&nbsp; Think of it all as 
	a river of air flowing from higher to lower elevations until the sun's heat 
	dissolves the inversion allowing the winds above to mix down to the ground.&nbsp; 
	Practically, it means that we often must do two or more setups at the sod 
	farm  –  one early and then one around 9AM.&nbsp; If there is a wind change 
	forecasted for higher up in the atmosphere, we may have to work around that, 
	too.</p>
