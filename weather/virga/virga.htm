	<h1>Virga</h1>
	<p>by Had Robinson</p>
	<p><span class="italics">"Virga is an observable streak or shaft of 
	precipitation that falls from a cloud but evaporates or sublimes before 
	reaching the ground" â€“ </span> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virga">Wiki</a></p>
	<p>In the photos below, virga can be seen in the distance at the base of the 
	darker clouds.&nbsp; There may not be any dangerous air nearby but why take 
	the chance?&nbsp; However, it is far enough away that the pilot who took the 
	photo was not in any danger.&nbsp; Virga from towering clouds, on the other 
	hand, can have tremendous force.&nbsp; It can hit the ground and spread out 
	in all directions like a tidal wave.&nbsp; The mountains in the distance are 
	the East Potrillo Mountains of south central New Mexico.&nbsp; This is some 
	of the higher territory near the Continental Divide of the southwest U.S. 
	and, consequently, a region that has more weather.<br><br>

	<img alt="virga in the Franklin Mountains" src="DSCN0073_01.JPG" width="1280" height="960"><br><br>As Wiki notes, virga can be extremely hazardous to aviation, 
	especially ultralights.&nbsp; The high heat of vaporization of the virga 
	creates pockets of cold air which can fall rapidly, gaining momentum until 
	it reaches the ground.&nbsp; The net effect is a severe downdraft which can 
	be a mile in diameter or just a dozen yards.&nbsp; An aircraft encountering 
	the vertical shear of the falling air while flying through the surrounding 
	air can be thrown out of control.<br>&nbsp;<br>Like virga, thunderstorms can 
	create downdrafts and shear with often fatal results for pilots.&nbsp; A 
	recent thunderstorm (1) mile west of Dona Ana County Airport, NM
	killed the pilot and his pilot passenger.&nbsp; Both had failed to get 
	available weather information before departing the airport.<br>&nbsp;<br>
	Ultralights should stay out of the air or land when virga is observed.&nbsp; 
	Here is a video by Bryan Snider Photography of a
	<a href="https://vimeo.com/135811823">powerful microburst</a> in Tucson, AZ.&nbsp; 
	There was virga associated with this storm.&nbsp; This storm would have been 
	exceedingly dangerous to be near....</p>
	<p>
	Here is a fully inflated paraglider that hit sheer caused by virga.&nbsp; 
	The shear was located to the right of the flight path and hit the right half 
	of the glider but not the left half.&nbsp; Virga is like a cannonball of air 
	dropping out of the sky.&nbsp; As the glider moved forward the collapse 
	continued across the wing to the left.&nbsp; The wing re-inflated safely 
	without cravats, damage, or excessive surge.&nbsp; However, the forces were 
	great enough to break some minor components of the harness.&nbsp; The pilot 
	had over 1,000' of altitude above ground which would have provided enough 
	time to throw a reserve parachute if there had been a problem.&nbsp; But 
	throwing a reserve is always a last resort to save your life....<br><br>

	Now, why would anyone with sense fly when virga has been observed?&nbsp; It 
	is easy to say, "Nothing will happen...."&nbsp; This is usually the case, 
	but not always.</p>
